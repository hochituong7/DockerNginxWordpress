Vì Chế độ xem danh sách cung cấp cho bạn cái nhìn tổng quan về tất cả các khối trong nội dung của bạn, giờ đây bạn có thể điều hướng nhanh chóng đến khối chính xác mà bạn cần.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" alt=\"Xem trước mẫu block\" width=\"370\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption>Xem trước mẫu block trước khi thêm vào</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Chuyển Widget thành Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Đây là một cập nhật đáng chú ý, chuyển giao diện Widget bản mặc định sang giao diện trình chỉnh sửa Block. Trong trường hợp giao diện không tương thích, bạn nên chuyển ngược lại bằng cách cài plugin <a href=\"https://vi.wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Classic Widgets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-widgets-blocks.png\" alt=\"Block widget mới\" width=\"356\" height=\"267\" /><figcaption>Block cho phép nhúng widget mới</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kweb.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/widget-area.png\" alt=\"Khu vực widget area mới trong WordPress 5.8\" class=\"wp-image-901\" width=\"459\" height=\"216\" /><figcaption>Giao diện Widget Area mới</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiển thị bài viết trong Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-query-loop.png\" alt=\"Block cho phép chèn danh sách bài viết\" width=\"385\" height=\"305\" /><figcaption>Block cho phép chèn danh sách bài viết</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Trong phiên bản WordPress 5.8, một trong những vấn đề đau đầu là cách hiển thị block danh sách bài viết đã được xử lý. Trình soạn thảo block cung cấp một block Query Loop cho phép lựa chọn nhiều tùy chỉnh từ số lượng bài viết, hiển thị danh mục, ngày tháng cho tới bổ sung pagination. Khá thuận tiện nhưng cũng vẫn là cơ bản và cần nhiều hơn cho một website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cấu trúc trang tổng thể</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png\" alt=\"Sắp xếp layer trong WordPress\" width=\"388\" height=\"303\" /><figcaption>Sắp xếp layer trong WordPress</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Có thể bạn cần một trang landing đơn giản, nhưng cũng có lúc bạn cần một cái gì đó mạnh mẽ hơn một chút. Khi các khối tăng lên, các mẫu xuất hiện và việc tạo nội dung trở nên dễ dàng hơn, cần có các giải pháp mới để làm cho nội dung phức tạp dễ điều hướng. Chế độ xem danh sách (List View) là cách tốt nhất để chuyển giữa các lớp nội dung và các block lồng nhau.

Ngay bây giờ, bạn có thể dùng thử trong Block Bài viết và Block Mạng xã hội. Khi nhiều mẫu được thêm vào, bạn sẽ có thể lấy cảm hứng để tạo kiểu cho trang web của mình mà không cần rời khỏi công cụ chỉnh sửa!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tạo kiểu và tô màu cho hình ảnh</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png\" alt=\"Thêm màu 2 lớp vào đối tượng\" width=\"453\" height=\"370\" /><figcaption>Thêm màu 2 lớp vào đối tượng</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tô màu các khối hình ảnh và bìa của bạn bằng các bộ lọc duotone! Duotone có thể thêm màu sắc vào thiết kế của bạn và tạo kiểu cho hình ảnh của bạn (hoặc video) để tích hợp tốt với giao diện của bạn. Bạn có thể nghĩ về hiệu ứng duotone như một bộ lọc đen trắng, nhưng thay vì bóng tối có màu đen và các điểm sáng có màu trắng, bạn chọn màu của riêng mình cho bóng tối và vùng sáng.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Đối với lập trình viên</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Đăng ký style chung và api của giao diện thông qua file <strong>theme.json</strong></li><li>Ngừng hỗ trợ IE11</li><li>Thêm format ảnh WebP</li><li>Thêm một số phần mở rộng tùy chỉnh cho block</li><li>Giới thiệu <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/03/wordpress-5-8-field-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Field Guide</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bài lược dịch từ <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/tatum/\" target=\"_blank\">Giới thiệu WordPress 5.8</a> Tatum bởi <a href=\"https://kweb.vn/ban-cap-nhat-wordpress-5-8-co-gi-moi/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://kweb.vn/ban-cap-nhat-wordpress-5-8-co-gi-moi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KWeb</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/07/21/wordpress-5-8/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Cập nhật bảo mật WordPress 5.7.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/05/13/cap-nhat-bao-mat-wordpress-5-7-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/05/13/cap-nhat-bao-mat-wordpress-5-7-2/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 May 2021 13:46:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Bản nâng cấp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/?p=985\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:365:\"Vào ngày 12/05/2021, bản cập nhật WordPress 5.7.2 đã được phát hành để khắc phục một lỗi bảo mật với PHPMailer.

I want to meet you and see you again! Don&#8217;t be shy.  Introduce yourself. Even if I am in conversation with someone else.

This is a fun little feature that was tucked into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">Gutenberg 13.9</a> changelog last month with very little fanfare:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Rich text: Add character shortcuts for wrapping selection. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">42469</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shortcut is a rich text feature contributed by Automattic-sponsored WordPress core committer Ella van Durpe. It works in a similar way that <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31571\">pasting a link over selection</a> will auto-link the text instead of replace it, a feature that landed seven years ago which she also worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new quotes shortcut escaped my notice until I saw George Mamadashvili&#8217;s quick video demo on Twitter: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My new favorite Block Editor shortcut is the ability to wrap selected text in quotes. Select text and press `, \' or \". <br /><br />This nifty little feature shipped with Gutenberg 13.9. However, the editor always supported air quotes. <a href=\"https://t.co/VnPqv6E44U\">pic.twitter.com/VnPqv6E44U</a></p>&mdash; George Mamadashvili (@Mamaduka) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mamaduka/status/1565761697989726209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 2, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a clever feature that is commonly supported by IDE&#8217;s like IntelliJ and PyCharm. Although wrapping with quotes is likely the most common use case for this type of shortcut, it also supports wrapping the selection with a back tick (<code>`</code>), which will automatically wrap it in a code tag instead of replacing the selection with a back tick. van Durpe demonstrated this in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">PR</a> with a gif:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you frequently copy and paste text that is meant to be in quotes, or code that needs backticks, this new shortcut is a major timesaver and one of the most exciting features to land in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">13.9</a>. van Durpe said it was generalized to work with any characters, such as pressing <code>(</code> to wrap the selection in parenthesis, instead of deleting the selection. However, this was scaled back a bit during the review before the PR was merged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit worried with expanding these to characters that are natural openers because I suspect it&#8217;s a typical action to select a word and type the first letter of what should replace it — parentheses and quotation marks, in particular, would have a much higher incidence of cases where the intention is indeed to replace the selected text with the mark, not to wrap it in them,&#8221; Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura concluded that it&#8217;s worth testing but suggested more characters be added incrementally to focus feature announcements on the ones they are more certain about &#8220;without the ones that could be problematic tainting the feature.&#8221; This is possibly the reason it wasn&#8217;t highlighted in the release post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backtick and quote characters are the only two included in this iteration of the feature. It&#8217;s not easy for users to discover in the natural course of using the editor, so it might need a little promotion for people to start using it enough to know if it&#8217;s going to become one of those indispensable features or something that is inadvertently causing frustration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Sep 2022 03:29:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Performance Team Takes Over WP Super Cache Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-performance-team-takes-over-wp-super-cache-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4657:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a>, one of the oldest and most widely used static caching plugins for WordPress, is changing hands. After 15 years, the plugin&#8217;s author, <a href=\"https://odd.blog/\">Donncha Ó Caoimh</a>, is handing over maintenance and development to Jetpack&#8217;s performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been building WordPress sites since the early days, you are almost guaranteed to have used WP Super Cache on at least one project (or hundreds). It is based on an earlier plugin called WP Cache 2 that Ó Caoimh <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2007/11/05/wordpress-super-cache-01/\">forked in 2007</a> when its author had lost interest and was no longer developing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack&#8217;s performance team manages the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a>&nbsp;plugin, used by more than 100,000 sites, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/design/content-delivery-network/\">CDN</a>. In today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/wp-super-cache-joins-the-jetpack-family/\">announcement</a>, Jetpack assured current users that they will still be able to &#8220;enjoy its core features without a new plugin or a connection to Jetpack.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re excited to start working on WP Super Cache,” Jetpack Performance Lead Mark George said. “Our goal is to create an experience where anyone can make their site extremely fast without being an expert. We want to help make sure that WP Super Cache remains a reliable and easy option for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change in hands is not an acquisition. Ó Caoimh, who was the very first Automattic employee, confirmed the company did not buy the plugin from him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked in Automattic since the company was founded, so they&#8217;ve supported the development of the plugin all along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Really, the plugin is moving sideways in the company, from one developer to a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t have time to work on it properly. I&#8217;m working on other projects, mainly <a href=\"https://crowdsignal.com/\">Crowdsignal</a> now, and it was hard to find time to work on it. Jetpack will be able to do a lot more with it than I ever could.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ó Caoimh said the support burden for the plugin isn&#8217;t that bad, despite it being active on more than two million WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The plugin has a &#8216;debug log&#8217; that will log (almost) everything it does to a file, which makes it easier to figure out why a problem is happening a lot of the time,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn&#8217;t able to give the support forums the time it deserved either. Now, a team in Automattic will be helping answer questions and solve problems. It can only be a good thing for users of the plugin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ó Caoimh said handing over maintenance and development to the Jetpack team frees up time for his family and eliminates a source of stress, as he was worried that WP Super Cache wasn&#8217;t getting the attention it needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the past I worked on this late into the night but I have a family, and they come first,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jetpack team already has plans to modernize the plugin and will be investing more resources in support and new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While we research new features to help make WordPress sites cache faster, we will begin updating the WP Super Cache UI to bring it in line with modern standards, so it is easier to use,&#8221; Jetpack VP of Marketing Rob Pugh said. &#8220;In addition, we’ll be working behind the scenes to ensure it’s compatible with our other performance features like Jetpack Boost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 15 years, it&#8217;s impressive that WP Super Cache has maintained a 4.3 out of&nbsp;5&nbsp;stars rating on WordPress.org with 1,296&nbsp;reviews. With the Jetpack team&#8217;s resources, support in the forums is likely to improve, and users can expect to see more improvements as the plugin now has a team of people moving it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have no regrets handing over the plugin to Jetpack,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to create and maintain a plugin that might be used by a handful of sites, but this plugin is used by two million sites. If I introduced a subtle error that impacted people using WordPress in a manner I hadn&#8217;t thought of that might cause problems for thousands of websites. The itch that I scratched by creating WP Super Cache has well and truly been scratched and has long healed.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 20:46:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 67) — What Does Professionalism Mean in WordPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=114431\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/what-does-professionalism-mean-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56782:\"<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Dan and Eric discuss their top picks for WordPress news stories of the week and the topic of professionalism.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Not bad. Um, yeah, another, another week coming, coming down to, uh, to a close and assembling the, the stories that matter. We want to, um, get into our often jampacked newsletter and thinking about, um, weird camp coming up. And, um, I think everyone\'s getting geared up for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, So what\'s, what\'s on the top of your mind this week, I wanted to kinda run through the top three, um, news stories of, um, the commentary issues, questions in the WordPress space that, uh, matter to you. And I\'ve gotta got a few, two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think the biggest thing that came out to me is that, uh, the whole WebP support in, uh, WordPress six point ones kind of being reconsidered at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thought that was, uh, a lot of community pushback on, uh, how they were going to implement it and kind of nice to see the, uh, leadership, uh, in, you know, the developers take a step back and kind of think things through again,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. Yeah, that\'s gone back and forth quite a bit. I, I got a little lost, um, keeping up and like, like you and your earlier writing about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think a lot of us feel, boy that would turning that on by default, um, is, is not something we like is there should be. An option or at least, uh, I don\'t know. I could see, I could see putting in a default for new installs or something like that, but for, to suddenly switch, um, potentially, um, everyone over from JPEGs or, or whatever, that\'s, isn\'t that the main sticking point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, basically it would take, um, what was being proposed was that if you uploaded a, a JPEG or a PNG file or whatever, uh, WordPress would automatically convert it to a WebP and use. And so there\'s, you know, talk about, well, that takes up a lot of server resources. Um, WebP isn\'t supported in every browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s like specific versions of safari that are a few years old that don\'t, you know, uh, support it yet. And just all the files that it\'s gonna create, cuz you know, WordPress creates three or four versions of every image you upload. And if it\'s doing that again for WebP versions, You know, some folks on cheaper hosting accounts could run outta space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And then there\'s the whole idea of, you know, WordPress is all about controlling your content and controlling your process. And to me, that\'s kind of a, the oddity of it. It\'s like, well, they\'re gonna force you to use this format that by the way Google created and you know, yeah. Not everybody wants to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think, you know, having a check box makes a lot of sense, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s, uh, I was looking at, um, working on, um, towards editing on the, uh, web Almanac, um, which a number of WordPress people contribute to each year for, um, CMS section of that. And, um, their data set where they compile, um, run a bunch of queries on a test population and, you know, see how many are using WordPress and Elementor stands out to, and, you know, WordPress is just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing the numbers are, are way out there. And you start to think about, um, the dramatic impact it, it would have with, um, Switching a format to, you know, suddenly becoming very heavily used, like, um, like WebP, which, which I\'ve kind of been in favor of, uh, from a sustainability perspective, because end performance it\'s, it\'s generally faster and is gonna use less bandwidth and let\'s storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you duplicate, you still have all those old JPEGs and you duplicate that. And yeah, you\'re really adding a lot in that, in that respect, it\'s not saving, uh, saving the planets and. Particularly well, um, but I haven\'t seen that side of the discussion come up, um, on it, but I, I, uh, I know there are people who care about, um, just how much we\'ve got in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just junk and it\'s taken cost in electrons, power every day. Um, so it, it will be interesting to see how that gets, that gets sorted out. Um, I\'m sure more efficient formats are where we\'re headed. um, so my, my, um, my number one pick is, is not really something that\'s been tackled yet. I\'m sure people are starting to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t, uh, I have to let things settle and think about a bit, but there\'s a, there\'s a big running discussion that started in two channels, two threads and, and, uh, post data is slack. Piracy G or unethical behavior with cloning, um, you know, G GPL clubs that get hold of a commercial license and crack, uh, WordPress plugins and, and so on, and then re resell this, uh, cheaply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s always been a thing. Uh, I think I remember that going on in ju. Um, there\'s we all know the reasons why that\'s a bad idea, hurts people\'s businesses. There\'s often malware that comes along as a payload with your free, cheap cracked software. Um, but this, at the same time, one of the big culprits here, um, was adding in some, adding in some new product that is sort of specialized at a niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s not, you know, it\'s not, uh, Cheap plugins are some quite high end things targeted at hosts. Um, so it\'s a, it can be really devastating to some people\'s business model. If, if it were, um, if it was costing them, their target audience, some people feel actually, you shouldn\'t worry about this because the only people using it or kids or people who aren\'t your customers anyway, um, but this one particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting, uh, pirated, uh, GPL club. Where\'s archives, spammed, a ton of people, including people who are in the middle of this discussion. Uh, just at that moment, um, got a lot of Twitter, DMS and, and other things, uh, straight at people who totally don\'t want is going on. So, um, Allie Niman suggested, well, you know, one way we could come combat, this is go at the host and say, there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spamming. Um, there\'s been some discussion of what could we do collectively to fight back and protect the ecosystem. Um, have you taken a look at those discussions or seen this come up in the past and have thoughts on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. There have been a number of cases over the years where people\'s plugins have been forked and stolen and, you know, resold that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I, I wonder how many of those plugins are actually in product. Especially on high level sites. I mean, if you are a web designer who is, you know, partaking in something like that, uh, you know, clients may have these things on their sites and not know it. I wouldn\'t think there\'s a huge number, but yeah, I think Allie\'s, uh, you know, Suggestion of going after hosting is, is, is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think maybe it could go after payment gateways too. I know, like, especially PayPal has been rough on anyone. Who\'s doing anything sketchy over the years. You know, if, if that\'s gets reported, they may get their, uh, their payment gateway shut down, which, you know, could kind of cripple their ability to redistribute this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I mean, I do think WordPress leadership should speak out on it. You know, I, I know that\'s, I mean, it\'s not just a WordPress issue. It\'s, it\'s a software issue. It\'s an open source issue, but you know, just some sort of statement, you know, maybe even at word camp us about, you know, let\'s protect this ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s make sure. You know, everybody\'s playing by the rules and that we, you know, if we find someone who\'s not, we should, you know, make, uh, everyone aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I\'ve I\'ve often thought, man, I wish there was some advocacy. I wish we had like a nonprofit or, or some collective where we supported, uh, advocacy for open source to both educate people who know nothing about it, the consumers and everyone else and just show, Hey, look, this is a professional space where people are making, living from small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers solo people. Who\'ve been at it a long time, basically family businesses, all the way up to, um, in the bigger, the bigger companies that are heavily by everyone else. It\'s a, it\'s a big family and, uh, they\'re real people here. And if you, you support these products, it\'s, uh, it\'s hurting us. So there\'s kind of that, um, The, uh, tending the collective governments, governance of an industry as a commons like this, an open source one there\'s, there should be things that, um, outside of the project, even that, that people in, in the WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can do that would kind of be on the list of Eleanor Ostrom\'s, um, things that healthy ecosystems, healthy commons do to, uh, to protect themselves where you, you find the bad actors and find ways to suppress and discourage that. And sometimes if they\'re internal to the community, you wanna, you know, not completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demonize them, but give some kind of carrots and stick so that there\'s incentives to come back and be a good contributor. And you know, some host, straight anger, rage on the internet is just adding to useless stressful stuff. Maybe there\'s a win in this and on the advocacy and education side. But, uh, I also threw out the idea that since the WordPress foundation does legal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense of the WordPress trademark. Uh, this is like one step away. Suppose you had good citizens who are doing five for the future. Um, and they\'re, they don\'t have quite the means to individually defend themselves in the same way or they\'re are there ways we could, um, pull together and help each other through, um, through that, through the foundation or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Um, yeah, you would think there, there could at least be some sort. Guide to, uh, steps you can take, you know, I know they, they have lawyers working on their side, as you said, to protect trademarks and, and things like that. You know, even if it\'s just general advice to come out and say, Hey, your, your, your, your plugin has been selling on the black market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what you can do. Here\'s some resources that would, you know, seem like at least the basic way to, to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I think it\'s kind of a black eye for. Uh, for any, any business ecosystem, uh, people looking to get into it. Um, it may not understand quite what\'s going on, but it looks if it looks like you\'re laying down to predators, um, who have gotten entrenched it\'s it\'s not a good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign for the healthiness of the ecosystem. And it, it would, um, definitely be good for morale to have some, some clear boundaries defined and say like, this is not okay in our, in our world. And we\'re not gonna support this anyway and find what we can do to limit it. Um, over, I wrote about this a few weeks ago, because FIUs had on their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pretty long post about dealing with this. Um, and we\'ve, we\'ve done this before people getting courseware stolen. It can be content that can be all kinds of things getting ripped off. Um, When you, you may or may not have any intellectual property rights over it. If it\'s, if it\'s GP stuff, um, some is some isn\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but they, they actually had some interesting, uh, case studies or, or people who, who didn\'t fly off the handle, they would get, ultimately you\'re getting support requests from people who have. This pirate did stuff. And sometimes they don\'t know, um, what they\'ve done or what situation they\'re in. And someone had found that it was kind of a teachable moment where they could educate and, and convert some of these people into customers and say like, oh, okay, we\'re not gonna give you support until you\'re actually our customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people just needed that. They just needed the education, I guess. So, um, there\'s maybe there is some win possible there. Um, All right. Well, what\'s your, uh, what\'s your next pick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Okay. Well, I have to go with the, uh, little scandal about, uh, WP optimize and the alleged cheating on, uh, performance tests by, uh, turning off all JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and when it\'s, uh, under a, a testing user agent, I guess it\'s, it\'s able to detect that. Say okay. It\'s GT metrics or it\'s, uh, page feed insights. And in that case, we\'re gonna turn off all of our, all of your site\'s JavaScript to boost your score and make you feel good about yourself, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. So that got quickly compared to the Volkswagen scandal a few years back, and there may have been another manufacturer car manufacturer doing that when you hook the cars up to a, uh, Uh, emissions test, um, they, uh, turn the catalytic converter and filters on and rest of the time, uh, it, it\'s not on and you get, um, better performance on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I don\'t, if it yeah, probably affects fuel economy. Right. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah, I think it was, I want to, I think it does. And then it also, I mean, the pollutants that came out of those cars on the road,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Way more than the legal limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really bad. And so they had, it was a huge blow for the, um, for the brand, uh, a huge amount of distrust, uh, and, and a blow for what everyone, you know, probably was a really solid brand Volkswagen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the. The interesting. I, I remember I, this was a, when I was teaching writing last, um, there was a Corey doctoral piece about this. Well, it brought it in as an example, and he was talking about we\'re dangerously going into a. A future where software can be so sophisticated, we don\'t really know what it\'s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t even really know if the experience we\'re having is software mediated with an there\'s an algorithm that is manipulating the semi virtual experience we\'re having. So is your, is your WordPress really? You know, what\'s it doing? Uh, who\'s it talking to, um, Are you, are you, when you think you\'re doing tests, are you getting valid, um, results?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, the trust issue is, is interesting. Um, how, how has the response been from, um, from the company that has allegedly this, this code in it that is sort of a cheater code on, um, op optimization tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. So Sarah Gooding at the WP Tavern put. Article together that, uh, spoke with, uh, one of the lead developers of WP optimize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, according to him, it was a code that was forked over from another plugin. And I have to plea ignorance on the name of that plugin right now. But, uh, apparently they were in talks to maybe, um, acquire this plugin. And at the time they decided to, um, kind of merge some code in there to make it, um, You know, to get ready for this big merger they were gonna have, which ended up falling through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, it ended up that they forgot the code was in there. The deal fell through. And, um, they weren\'t quite sure why the code was still in there or, you know, kind of pleaded ignorance on it. Um, but then Sarah also came up with a, an article the day after that, uh, kind of dug into it more where I guess, you know, this, the, um, the, the settings in this plugin are also a little bit up too, so they\'re not, uh, completely clear on what they\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you know, there\'s, it, it, it may be not an intentional thing, but at the same time, it still doesn\'t look very good. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it will be interesting to see how quickly and how well that that clears up. Um, yeah, I really care about the trust, the trust issues, and you know, again, kind of like the, the piracy, if, if you, if there\'s a widespread perception of, we can\'t trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain brands or theoretically any hypothetically anyone in the, in our ecosystem. It it\'s a, that\'s a really bad consequence where so much trust is at, at the core of making open source work. But in a sense, it\'s open source working. Someone looked at the code</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah. It\'s interesting that somebody was able to test that and found that what it was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, I don\'t know. I I\'m, I\'m not a huge believer in these metrics. Um, you know, they, I don\'t wanna say they\'re made up, but they\'re, they are kind of made up and they don\'t always reflect, I don\'t think, you know, the actual user experience. Right. But, you know, I think any of these systems we bring out, somebody\'s gonna find a way to cheat on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you wanna cheat on your performance test and get yourself, you know, a little bit of an ego boost by saying, oh, I scored a 99. You. And so be it, um, you, you are the one that kind of has to live with it, but I think the plugin should, at the very least be very clear about what they\'re doing and you know, what it\'s used for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\'s good about it. And, you know, here\'s how you shouldn\'t use it. Um, which, you know, they apparently did not do in this case. Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it, it does pose again to me, like interesting questions about what could we do better as a community collectively to incentivize good behavior around performance. Can there be kind of a general working standard or guidance on for plugin authors and for users?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what we\'re looking for? What makes afor, what, what\'s the margin of, of a good performance plugin or just. I wish if you had details, when you\'re down, you you\'re in the.org repo, how many queries does has add to your page? What kind of, what are the main dependencies here? Um, is there a quick way to get a heads up on that sometimes, um, before you in install something and then find out , um, all, all of, um, all of the work being done in performance core is, is really outstanding and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it\'s probably wrong to think about it as this is just a core, that\'s their problem. And this is a, a core thing. There\'s, there\'s a huge plug in ecosystem where, uh, testing and standards could be, um, a bit more rigorous and that it sort of came up a bit with a proposal from, um, uh, Felix aren\'t to, um, um, look at to when, when plugins are submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, To, uh, test specifically around performance and security, a little bit more rigorously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> And yeah, I mean, we have, I mean, you know, where I live, we have, uh, energy star appliances, right. That means that they\'re certified as being efficient. You know, maybe there\'s a third party out there that can do that for plugins, or I don\'t know if the word price folks would wanna do that necessarily, but, you know, we have, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could have like some sort of, uh, certification system that says, Hey, this plug. You know, performs well and is lean and is secure. Yeah, of course that, you know, it\'s hard with software because there\'s no guarantees. Um, of course your refrigerator could break the day after you bring it home. But you know, things interesting to thank see if somebody would ever, uh, come up with something like that, that you know, and how legitimate it could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah, that could be really useful. Um, maybe if it was a consensus or amongst hosts who, you know, doing anything at scale, the, the, the performance, um, matters in dollars in significant dollars. Um, and yeah, we should think more about that. Um, my, my next pick was, um, Gravity acquires gravity. Um, the, uh, uh, gravity forms, um, uh, acquire G gravity flow and, uh, and the services, um, oriented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what was it name,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> name, uh, gravity experts. I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, gravity experts. Okay. Um, not too familiar with those, but these are, uh, product and, and services in the gravity forms ecosystem that, um, we\'re are owned and were owned and developed by, um, one of, uh, gravity\'s team members. Um, so that\'s, that\'s kind of an interesting story is I don\'t, I\'m not aware of anyone, anyone else building an E plug in ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around their product and working that closely where your employees are, are developed. Uh, I would assume, uh, encouraged to develop a product or service related to it on their own, and then maybe it really takes off and bring it back in into the, um, parent company. Um, Is that, is that something unusual they\'ve innovated with it\'s you\'re not being taken over by a big, uh, a conglomerate it\'s it\'s the family you\'re already</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I kind of think that\'s interesting. Isn\'t it? I mean, you do a side project based on your everyday job and then your boss essentially buys your product. It\'s like getting a really good bonus at work. You don\'t don\'t really get that. So I, I, I kind of think it\'s cool though. Um, you know, gravity forms, if you use it a lot, I mean, you notice there are tons of, you know, official extensions and they have a whole third party directory now and they go through and certify certain add-ons, uh, third party add-ons on their site that you can look through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, kind of a neat thing. I mean like gravity flow. Um, allows you to really do some complex things with, um, what happens when a form gets submitted. You can tie it in with a bunch of third party services or have it do different things on your site. So I think that just is such a natural fit for gravity forms that, you know, why wouldn\'t they wanna sell something that does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Um, and then gravity experts is a service. That\'ll do a lot of customization and. As I mentioned to you off the air, I think that, you know, they probably get a lot of customization requests through their support. Sure. Um, and I\'ve actually just from my own experience, found their support to be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They tend to, I mean, they don\'t mind sending you code snippets to use for, to achieve certain things. Um, this steps it up a whole other level. Um, you know, if you need customization services, well, we have that too. Um, you know, why not keep that all in house and you. And maybe some of the customizations they create could end up being products on their own too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it would be a great way to kind of continue to grow their</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> business. Yeah. It\'s a really, it\'s a really cool thing. And I, I wonder if anyone else is, is doing that. It, it, it occurs to me. The advantage of it is, is that, um, your own in internal people know that product best, but there\'s not really, if they\'re already working for you there, there\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you budget and, and allocate like, Hey, go and develop, you know, blue sky, even, you know, go and build, uh, add-ons for this. Um, and, and see what we come back with. It\'s a totally different thing. Um, the incentives are, are not there as if you\'re, you\'re building this as your own product and in if it\'s good enough, um, it\'s you, you gotta get it to the point of maturity and, and quality where a competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Might actually want it or someone else might. And, um, then I guess you\'re, you\'re really establishing value in a, um, a clear and somewhat more neutral way while still totally being within this, um, sub economy, this E gravity ecosystem. It\'s a smart, smart way to own and share it collectively and not smother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity and things like that. And yeah, I just don\'t, there\'s no other way to, um, to do something like that in the usual, usual way where some outside company would absorb something else. And then maybe the quality, you know, there\'s just stereotype or fear the quality\'s gonna drop off cuz it\'s a different,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually we worry, even plugins get acquired, but not in this case because it\'s, you know, the OG has it now, so we don\'t have to worry about, you know, them. You know, making it less quality or, or not supporting it? Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, it\'s a fantastic model. I think others should seriously take note. There\'s plenty of, um, plenty of other ecosystem plugins that, uh, have this potential for that kind of collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, good one. Okay. So yeah. What\'s your, what\'s your third?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Pick. So my third one is that, uh, wordpress.com this week announce that they\'re gonna start offering $499 websites to anyone who wants one it\'s, uh, supposed, supposed to be done within four business days. Uh, they\'ll give you a choice of themes or they\'ll pick one for you, which is kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you pick my theme. Um, I, I, I kind of wonder. Who the target is and what the strategy is here. Are they just trying to get you in the door? So that you\'re kind of part of their wordpress.com ecosystem you kind of, uh, a different, uh, different strategy? I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s, uh, it\'s interesting. I did write about this, um, because it was, I, I love it when, you know, we have, we have about a 10 year, um, backlog, uh, Back issues and, you know, things that have, uh, we can look back and see the history on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I thought it was a further back, but it was just probably about a year ago that, um, wordpress.com did that for the first time where they introduced a premium, um, built with wordpress.com service, which this seems to be an add-on to that the, uh, part of. Same brand, but the, the initial one a year ago was, um, not supposed to compete with freelancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was priced at around $5,000, um, as a baseline that seems to have come down in their FAQ. Now it\'s, it\'s around three. So there\'s still this, this premium layer. And I think that was supposed to use, um, Agencies and people within the ecosystem to do some of this work. I\'m not, we really haven\'t got, I don\'t think anyone has dug into that or gotten numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were very curious to, to see what, um, what might come out of that in, in terms of its success for wordpress.com and who\'s how many sites are being brought into it. What that it\'s, we\'re, we\'re very data poor. About the economics and details of the market. And that also made me think too, in this, in this story, that, um, is it, is that really competing or over the same piece of the pie or is there, is there so much there it\'s not, um, not a, not a threat to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so freelancers, small agencies, the way they, they might think, um, you can do very different things and I can see why.com wants to, you know, continually expand at, um, where it\'s easier to do that, where it\'s always had more market share at the lower end of, of the market. Uh, but when you\'re freelance, those, those are not necessarily the jobs you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> So I, I actually made a joke online that I would rather like farm up stuff I don\'t want to do to them because at that price point I\'m, you know, probably gonna lose money. So yeah, if they wanna take on that, that small stuff, that\'s, that\'s cool with me, but right. Um, it is kind of interesting to, to think that they\'re going after that, that market too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. Right, but I think you\'re right about, about them not wanting about a lot of people on the lower end, going to wordpress.com to start out because it is kind of managed</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> for them. Right. And as they pivot more and more to presenting themselves as, as a managed WordPress host, um, with. With that market in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, there, there are others already doing, doing this. Why, why let competitors have a, a free run at this? Um, they\'re doing the same thing, but.com now I\'ll Hey, you can, uh, you can install pretty much anything in the repo. I, I think, and there\'s a commercial ecosystem within there. You can buy Yost and everything else right from within there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as it grows, it\'s not, you know, it\'s not. The way to look at that is still ecosystem growth with opportunities for, um, plugins and services and other things like that. But, um, I also feel like we looked so much at the market share number and where it\'s biggest is the, um, top 10 million plus active sites with WordPress installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, it\'s the bigger universe. And you assume that these are. People\'s personal blogs and so on. But, um, because they\'re not, it\'s just by traffic, you know, they\'re not in the top 10,000, but, um, when I did a lot more freelancing, a lot of the clients I had that were good would be established. Nonprofits, local governmental things, um, people with, with significant budgets, but they\'re their traffic is they don\'t care about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, that much necessarily. Um, they\'re not doing even doing much content marketing. Maybe they have a newsletter. They\'re speaking to a very. Specific audience that may be numbered in the hundreds or the thousands. They\'re doing a lot on social. So they would be considered in this low end of the market, but that\'s, um, but by assessing their site by traffic, but it\'s not a that\'s completely a misnomer, then they would have no, no use for a, um, A hired site builder, even they need, they need an agency or, or someone with a capacity to do support in the hosting and a rather much more elaborate feature set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that market, that market is always there. I, I, I think people forget that and you\'re not gonna be killed off by the $500, four day service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> No. And, and I mean, if they they\'ve talked about, you know, wanting to compete with some of these proprietary systems like Wix, And I think that\'s kind of the same market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, people that want to not spend a ton of money and maybe in this case, they don\'t even really wanna build it themselves. They just want something up there and maybe as they grow, they go to something bigger. But to start out, you know, it\'s not a huge investment and. You know, those are the folks that I think aren\'t necessarily attracted to freelancers, not just cuz of budget, but because you know, somebody wants to try a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somebody wants to start their small business and with no guarantee of how long that\'s going to last, you know, is that client going to still be there for you in two years? And if they are, you know, what\'s the value. Are you getting so many support requests that you can\'t necessarily deal with? So in that way, I, I, I don\'t think this is a bad thing to kind of tie them all into that, that one service, uh, it might, it might be, you know, something more beneficial for them that where they can even leave at any time they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, the business goes belly up, you know, it\'s, it\'s not as tangled and messy as it might be getting away from an agency or a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I\'m, I much rather have them on, um, on.com or anything in the WordPress ecosystem than WX. Um, which I still, man, I have a, I was in, I\'ve had to use it again recently for a, a local nonprofit I\'m, uh, helping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I, I don\'t like, I don\'t like Wix . Um, and I\'m just thinking like, if, as this organization grows and what\'s needs, are it, it needs open source. It needs WordPress. It needs data security. Um, there. There are things that maybe they\'re not in a position to pay for, but they\'re at this point, but their success will get them into that at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and there as a, um, running your own business, that\'s a kind of, you can only do that. You know, you, you can ask those questions and do the discovery and form the relationship and say, look, these are, these are the needs you really have. And, um, what\'s. What\'s really the best product or, or thing here. And sometimes that leads to long good relationships with, uh, a decent paying client who may get a lot bigger, um, in that budget at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. All right. Well that, that all kind of ties in kind of nicely, um, to the last thing, um, kind of our topic we wanna open up for kind of long term discussion and get. People engaged with, um, kind of a big central one for, for post status. And, and I think everyone working in this space is, is professionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what does it mean to be a WordPress professional? We say we\'re the post status is the community for WordPress professionals. And that\'s an interesting phrase that\'s really kind of come into, I would say, in the last five to 10 years, um, widespread use in our community. And what does that, what does that mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, As an individual as a, and within the community and the, the business ecosystem, uh, to be a WordPress professional and professionalism in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, WordPress professionals kind of interesting, cuz it started out as a small blogging platform, right. And people were using it as more of a hobbyist thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of a sudden, you know, the theme and plugin markets kind of exploded and we. Using it as a full blown CMS and, you know, for all sorts of projects from, you know, the, the little tiny startups to enterprise. So I think the professionalism part of it is, you know, that there\'s a lot of traditional parts to professionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I, I think being polite and honest and, you know, hardworking and all those things come to come to mind, but then, um, it also meets kind of. The WordPress way. That\'s a little bit more relaxed. I think that kind of reflects, I think that reflects on Matt Mullenweg a little bit. He\'s not always, you know, the, uh, old fashioned stuff, shirt, CEO that mm-hmm , you know, gets up there and makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, grand pronouncements necessarily. Um, but it also, I think, reflects on, you know, the word camp culture of just kind of going come as you are. Um, but generally, you know, being kind to one another being open, uh, to discussion doesn\'t always work out that way. But, um, yeah, I think it\'s, it\'s an interesting way to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress these days. I mean, cuz a lot of us make a living with it. Um, either full time or at least part of the time and you know, the ground rules that applied for other sorts of businesses over the years don\'t necessarily, you know, apply here. Uh, it\'s a little bit different kind of ecosystem I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it definitely is. I, I think people hear that. That word and there\'s sort of the, you know, the larger corporate stereotype of, um, well, there\'s, there\'s good thing. There\'s good. Basic definitions of, you know, you show up every day, you do the, you do the work every day, no matter what, um, the basics of it, but there\'s also the, um, the kind of the negative, um, connotations of professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, In, in a more corporate scaled up space, that\'s kind of lost the human and individual element, the personal element, and doesn\'t have this kind of big family community of relations necessarily. And I, I mentioned to you a, a friend, um, Sarah Shelman. Who\'s got a book. I think that touches this. She runs a, they do a lot with WordPress, but it\'s a, it\'s a social design agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re they\'re anthropologists and ethnographers who try to solve, um, Largely institutional social problems and municipal governments and lend advice on, um, dealing with things like homelessness and, and, uh, why do helping institutions often they\'re too bloodless and faceless and impersonal to help very real individual human problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, I got to know, I got to know her. And there are people last year. I\'ll probably do it again. We\'re working with, um, kind of post COVID recovery projects or city is, um, funding. Uh, we just listened to people\'s stories and got them to talk about wellbeing and what that means for them. And, uh, it\'s, it\'s a very unusual kind of, wooy even kind of, hippie-ish, uh, weird thing that you don\'t usually associate with government, um, bureaucracies doing something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals listening to each other and caring something about the experience and totality of each other\'s lives. Um, you know, that might be good for good for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> We use more of</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that. Absolutely. Yeah. And she, we were talking about professionalism specifically after this and she said, Yes. The, the dysfunctional form of that, that we try to overcome is, is the sense that you\'ve got to create a mask of invulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there\'s coinciding and even integral to word breast professionalism, WordPress professionals, and professionalism is that you can be known as a person who has. A full life and all these other things going on. And, uh, we talk about that and there\'s, there\'s not as much of this kind of informal or private segregation from the business side, especially, maybe on, you know, on those who\'ve been in it a long time or contributors and, uh, small businesses and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s a, really, a really healthy thing for people. And it translates to a healthy community and I think a healthy. Business ecosystem, um, because it takes the edge off of straight hard competition, the tendency for towards paranoia and reaction and meanness, uh, especially on remote and internet stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I feel like that\'s a, a big part of it. And when we, uh, Michelle Frette featured, um, ran, uh, or featured, uh, member spotlight for. The week and, um, well known to many, many people, Jonathan Boer. Um, who\'s now at automatic as, um, working on training, which is a kind of newer and big thing there, um, impacting the, the community and doing code instruction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and he said some really good things that, um, I think define. Him and others as a, a good model of, of what professionalism is. And he, you know, there\'s power to change lives and people finding, um, their footing in the community and in work here. And, um, what else was, was, was in here. It was just a very, there were very personal flavor to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'re not doing kind of faceless, um, Roles and cubicles here. A lot of people really value that freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, you can see it as you know, we\'re not afraid to let our human side show, which I think is like really refreshing. I mean, if you look at a lot of the more traditional corporations out there, I mean, when do you see their leadership out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like just being humans. Um, and of course it\'s at a much greater scale, but, um, Just just even, even with, uh, Corey Miller, um, you know, talking about the struggles that he\'s had and, you know, I mean, he\'s a very successful person and you know, he, he and, uh, his family have done a lot in WordPress, but you know, he\'s still ha not afraid to show some vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s so important. I mean, did you don\'t feel like you have to put up a facade? Um, you know, that\'s one thing I\'ve. Kind of felt comfortable with in the, in this, uh, community, is that if I\'m having a bad day, I can say that on Twitter and, you know, still being thankful for what I have. I could still say, it\'s not been a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t done well. You know? Um, not every industry really accepts that and would, you know, applaud that. But I think ours generally does. And I think that\'s something we should not take for grant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I, I, I really, uh, value that too. And, and agree with that. I think that, um, Jonathan and you, and I have probably been around this around the same period of time going back 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re in the generation X category, um, where, um, yeah, we might have slack or tendencies, but I, I think it was still, it was still younger people and, and down to my kids\' ages, who. Really more comfortable with, um, not separating who they are in their private lives and you get messy, even, you know, politics and, and feelings about a variety of things that we don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you don\'t have to pretend that doesn\'t exist. It\'s it\'s a really, it can be a really fine line. You don\'t there\'s there\'s oversharing. There\'s there\'s stuff it has to balance out, but yeah, somehow. When we\'re healthy, uh, as a community advantages to work out. And Jonathan mentioned, um, post status is being a place that serves that by, um, not just you can go there for answers and social kind of hanging out and, um, Fun things and, and, and, uh, there\'s always plenty of good humor, but there\'s, he also mentioned having bigger philosophical discussions around business, open source and everything, WordPress related in a respectful and inclusive way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, yeah, there\'s not, there\'s no way to define, there\'s no recipe for that, but we know it when, when we see it and that have being able to. Maintain a level of trust that comes from being real people to each other who care to know something and share things about each other. Um, and you know, the role that word camps play in that meetups for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mentoring becoming more of a thing, um, that we talk about and, and support. Um, it, it allows the hard stuff, the bad feelings, conflicts competition. In theory, and I think we\'ve seen this happen. people can work, work it out. It takes the edge off of that and becomes, um, a way where I don\'t know, pressure valve a yeah, it, it definitely performs, um, a, a healthy service to, um, a way to check in and, and maybe help each other maintain a, a healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and, and business culture, um, that is, that is professional in our own, our own way. Um, and all the, all the normal ways you\'d think about showing up, getting stuff done, being reliable and, um, the best you can every day, but also showing up as a, as a real person who values, trust and kindness and respect, um, between each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the more of that, more of that, the better, but . Do you have any other, uh, thoughts on, um, on that topic or where we, where that could go, uh, hoping to pull more people into to discuss it? Um, since it seems, seems like one of those kind of pressures, commodities that, you know, it\'s actually not an economic thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\'t, you can\'t buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> No, and it\'s, I think it it\'s good for your, for your own health, for the health of the community. And you know, when you can see others, whether you agree with them or not as, as a person, as opposed to, you know, sub distant object that you\'re, um, at odds with, or you want to, um, or you\'re competing against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it does take that edge off a little bit. It lets you just kind of take a deep breath and you know, I mean, we see arguments just like in any other community, but what I don\'t see is them becoming to the point where, um, at least in public where, you know, it it\'s just incredibly toxic. Um, and usually if things do go bad, there\'s always somebody else to come in and say, Hey, wait a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s, you know, take a deep breath, which. It\'s just, I think refreshing, I, I, I wish, and I won\'t go into it too far, but I wish we had, uh, you know, political leadership that could do the same thing we had, like, like, you know, a referee that could come in and voluntarily say, Hey, you guys don\'t agree, but that\'s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> tough. Yeah. And it\'s there, it\'s an ideal, we\'ll never be perfect at. Um, and. Yeah, to take one example, I\'m thinking about writing about, you know, one of the, um, a, a friend in, uh, uh, a country where democracy has been threatened and on the way and along a while. Um, and that\'s very widespread. We\'re all, we\'re seeing a lot of, uh, difficult times for some of the, the, the key values in the project, in the community and the, in our own lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and actually was. I think jailed and suppressed for things. He was blogging of a political nature on his WordPress blog in his, in his country. And, um, which you can imagine doesn\'t a number on you, um, psychologically and, and socially. And then of course, like anyone else, especially your plugin or theme author, or something like that, you run into what feels like unfairness at some point in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the, um, in your work life, in the ecosystem of, um, how decisions get made, how, how things are handled. And, um, I, I feel for people sometimes when we\'re not at our best, or even when things are, are perfectly fine, it\'s not, everything is not gonna go your way all the time and it can feel oppressive or like people are not living up to, uh, levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transparency or kindness as, as they should. And I try to think, yeah, you know, there\'s people coming from a lot of different contexts where, um, you wanna be sensitive to all that, but there\'s also, there\'s also a need to kind of bear up with, we\'re not always at our best. We\'re not, everything is not consistent the way we think it should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. That means try harder. Don\'t give up on it. Um, keep it\'s it\'s it\'s hard for a reason. It\'s not, uh, not something you can just take for granted. Um, yeah, and I wish there was more of it well said.

This has allowed the platform to amass a well-designed and solid body of work. However, we needed to mix things up a bit, to make theme development exciting again. The next default theme, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a>, will be a stripped-down base theme with a pool of style variations built by our design community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the community has not disappointed. By the deadline of August 31, theme authors had submitted over 33 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Style+Variation%22\">variations for consideration</a>. This was a reasonably significant turnout, considering that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">project&#8217;s kick-off</a> was less than a month before. That is not much time to create and execute a design, and some people shared multiple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final group of variations that will ship with Twenty Twenty-Three is set to be chosen by September 7. Not all will become an &#8220;official&#8221; variation. However, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/73\">discussion that proposes</a> a separate child theme that would offer even more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the oldest theme authors in the WordPress community, I was excited about this effort. There was no way that I could pass on the challenge of designing a custom variation. Plus, it fit in line with some of the current work I was doing in finding pain points around FSE for theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I will share my experience with <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-json/#global-styles-variations\">building a custom style variation</a> for Twenty Twenty-Three. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Style Variations?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are one of my favorite features of modern WordPress, second only to block patterns. They allow theme authors to ship multiple design presets that users can choose between via the Styles panel in the site editor, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Example style variations for Twenty Twenty-Three.\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations can be as simple as a couple of color or font changes to entirely unique designs in their own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Before Beginning: The Right Mindset</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing to keep in mind when designing a custom style variation is that you are not building a theme. You are skinning an existing theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to get carried away with grand ideas about what is possible but only become disappointed with the limitations of the global settings and styles framework. You can change things like typography, colors, and spacing, but there are times when you&#8217;re stuck with chosen presets when they are used within templates. You also cannot arrange layout elements to your liking. That would require, at least, a child theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are skins with a specific set of rules that you must follow. You do not quite have the full power of CSS at your disposal, but you can do some pretty nifty things under the current standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a custom style variation is an easy introduction to modern theme development. It is a way to get your feet wet, to gain an understanding of how <code>theme.json</code> works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing a variation for Twenty Twenty-Three was also like trying to hit a moving target at times. Because the theme was under active development during this process, it meant that anything could change on any given day. And, the more complex a style variation was, the more likely a change to the base theme would affect it. This should not be the case for established themes, but it did create additional hurdles to clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stepping into the Fray: Building a Custom *.json File</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />JSON file for a custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are one of the easiest onramps to WordPress theme development because creators only need to work from within one file. The usual complexities around theme development are of no concern for such a project. And, because the global settings and styles feature has a standard ruleset, it&#8217;s easy to make a few changes and see quick results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are <code>*.json</code> files that live in a theme&#8217;s <code>/styles</code> folder. In the case of Twenty Twenty-Three, the organizational structure might look something like the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs\">/twentytwentythree\n    /styles\n        /example-a.json\n        /example-b.json \n        /...\n    /theme.json\n    ...</code></div></pre>\n\n\n<p>Because my variation was named &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/86\">Rough Draft</a>,&#8221; it was located at <code>/styles/rough-draft.json</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom variations follow all the same rules as the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living/\"><code>theme.json</code> standard</a>. The one exception is that variations have a <code>title</code> field to differentiate them from the theme&#8217;s default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is an example of what my variation&#8217;s JSON file looked like:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"title\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Rough Draft\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {},\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"styles\"</span>: {}\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-4\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>With the basics out of the way, the variation can overwrite anything that is defined in the theme&#8217;s primary <code>theme.json</code> file. A creator can do something as simple as overwrite the <code>settings.color.palette</code> to create a new color scheme. Or, they can configure every possible setting and style under the standard ruleset, building a massively different work of art from the base theme design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Good: Wow, This Is Really Cool!</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view of custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>I have dabbled a bit here and there with custom style variations. I have long understood their potential, but I had yet to dive into a full-blown project, particularly one that could land in front of millions of users. I don&#8217;t know that my variation submission will be a part of the curated set, but it was just plain ol&#8217; fun tinkering with a design idea again. It was also far less stressful to not have to worry about every aspect of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the time constraint, I pulled my initial idea from an old theme I had created. Then, I went to work, breaking as much as anyone could break (<em>don&#8217;t forget that I was also on a mission to find pain points</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a small part of me that remembered exactly why I fell in love with WordPress in the first place. I felt like that same 21-year-old kid who had just learned to edit a theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code> file to make some minor color changes. This was the WordPress that I remembered from so long ago. The one where themes were not 100s of files and 1,000s of lines of code. It was about figuring out how to design for the first time and enjoying every minute of it, <em>warts and all</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m being entirely honest, I probably took things a bit to the extreme. After looking at a few other variations, I realized I had customized quite a bit more than most folks. This is not necessarily a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; thing. Rather, it was more of a <em>Justin-does-not-know-when-to-stop</em> thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, with a looming deadline for submission, I was unable to customize every feature that I had in mind. There are simply so many possibilities that I could have continued working on this for weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bad: Lingering Pain Points</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage view of custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>Between those moments of clarity and jaunts of glee were some rough moments. These were a necessary part of the process&#8212;someone needed to experience them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, why can I not control the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39380\">gap between posts in a Query Loop</a> so that it matches the spacing elsewhere in the theme? There are still missing features or design tools support. Fortunately, some of the issues I either ran into or reported upstream were fixed during this process, such as <code>theme.json</code>-support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43543\"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43587\">duplicate background</a> on the Code block. Plus, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v14.0.0\">Gutenberg 14.0</a> added spacing and typography support for a boatload of blocks, both blockers for many theme authors who have tried to adopt FSE features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming WordPress 6.1 will continue to improve the lives of theme authors who are taking advantage of the <code>theme.json</code> toolset. Compared to a year ago, there are far fewer of those tiny irritations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my initial issues were from building a design based on someone else&#8217;s system. It took me a bit to come to grips with Twenty Twenty-Three&#8217;s slug names, spacing presets, and similar bits. While I have a few opinions on a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38998#issuecomment-1053727408\">standard naming system</a>, there are no right or wrong answers here. Plus, such <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38998\">discussions are a can of worms</a> that would only get in the way of the theme&#8217;s progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to remember that I was skinning an existing theme. It was my job to apply my vision onto the canvas sitting in front of me. Once I was able to get in the right mindset for this project, that&#8217;s when all the fun began.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As I look over the past few weeks, I am genuinely having a hard time remembering any <em>truly</em> frustrating moments. What I recall the most is just having a blast building my Twenty Twenty-Three variation and testing those that others built. I cannot wait for the theme and its curated set of styles to be unveiled to the community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 15:00:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Post Status: Writing is a Challenging But Needed Profession in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=114274\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://poststatus.com/writing-is-a-challenging-but-needed-profession-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14334:\"<div class=\"wp-container-11 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The WordPress project, software, and community are equally important. They all play a role in ensuring growth, progress, and success. A sizeable economy of users, builders, and business owners depends on it. That’s why staying informed is vital.

We need more people within the WordPress community who are interested in writing and more places to amplify their voices. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">39</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Over the past decade, I’ve written about a lot of web-related subjects. I started with a focus on freelancing — mainly because that’s what I knew best. It was an area where I had experience and felt like I could be of help to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, WordPress soon became my topic of choice. The more projects I built with the content management system (CMS), the more I wanted to share. There was so much to learn and discover.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>It’s easy to criticize someone or something from afar. For example, there’s a difference between critiquing a random stranger’s parenting style and that of your best friend. Proximity makes a difference.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the software wasn’t my only inspiration. Having attended my first WordCamp in 2011, I was taken aback at how welcoming the WordPress community was. Not only could I level up my design and development skills, but I also had access to this incredible human resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience took me from merely building websites to wanting to be a part of something bigger. The community is what made me truly care about WordPress. And I couldn’t help but want to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Challenges of Writing About WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about WordPress made perfect sense. I wasn’t the greatest developer — but I could share what I’ve learned. I also felt an obligation to ask questions about the direction of the software and how it impacts the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those deeper topics are often difficult to write about. Not only do they require some critical thinking (not my greatest skill), but they also need to strike a delicate balance. Because, while a post may nominally be about software, it’s people that are the real subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, there are significant challenges in writing about WordPress and its community. What follows are some lessons and observations from my journey so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-sometimes-you-re-close-to-your-subjects\">Sometimes You’re Close to Your Subjects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to criticize someone or something from afar. For example, there’s a difference between critiquing a random stranger’s parenting style and that of your best friend. Proximity makes a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That applies to the WordPress community as well. While it’s global and we don’t all know each other personally, there are often connections. You may follow a particular person (or their employer) on social media. There’s a chance you use their product or service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complicates things — especially when there’s a reason to be critical of a situation. For instance, I’ve written about product decisions that I found questionable. One was a plugin that set itself to <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/ethical-dilemma-for-wordpress-plugin-developers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">automatically update</a> without user consent. Another involved a plugin that <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/wordpress-theme-plugin-license-expires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked access</a> to its settings screen after a user’s license expired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use both plugins and have generally enjoyed the experience. Thus, it felt a bit awkward to discuss them publicly. Yet I also felt it was necessary to try and explore various points of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these scenarios, I hope to lay out both sides of an argument and spark a productive discussion. Not everyone’s going to agree — but that’s OK. No rule says the debate has to be comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-have-to-fill-in-the-blanks-when-covering-wordpress-core\">You Have To Fill in the Blanks When Covering WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is difficult to produce and maintain. And when an app is as widely-used as WordPress, the job is even tougher. There’s simply no way to please everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As users, we all have our WordPress pet peeves. In my case, the clutter of the dashboard tends to drive me crazy — especially on content-heavy websites. And the block editor still has several bumps to smooth out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there’s the overall direction of the WordPress project. It’s no secret that a lot of resources have been allocated towards the block editor and Full Site Editing. Meanwhile, this changing landscape can create unease among those who make a living with the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it’s vital to take a closer look at what’s happening. This empowers the community to prepare for change and allows their voices to be heard as things evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several challenges for writers who take on these topics. The biggest is that official information can be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://speckyboy.com/new-wordpress-features-hard-to-find/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">very difficult</a> to find. It may require searching through Slack channels or digging up a post from one of several <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Make WordPress</a> blogs. And, even if you locate something relevant, there may still be some key information missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the decision-making process isn’t always clear to those of us on the outside. A lack of context in this area can lead to speculation. That, in turn, has the potential to create distrust within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about these subjects is a balancing act. You can only work with the facts you have. At the same time, it’s difficult to avoid speculating on how or why a decision was made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-discussing-project-leadership-is-tricky\">Discussing Project Leadership is Tricky</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the WordPress project can be confusing when it comes to leadership. Matt Mullenweg is the co-founder of WordPress. He’s also heavily involved in its direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, he’s the founder of Automattic — a commercial entity that runs WordPress.com, among other products. The company also sponsors a significant number of WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, WordPress is also free and open-source. It depends on volunteers for virtually everything. Except that some contributors are paid by their employers to do so via the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Five for the Future</a> initiative. Got all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a unique and seemingly complex arrangement. The result is a lot of gray area and uncertainty for even avid observers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we typically know the project leads for various tasks, there are still questions about who’s doing what, and where decisions come from. Does Mullenweg have the final say over everything? Do sponsored contributors have more clout than volunteers? Where do the interests of WordPress.org and WordPress.com start to diverge?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are fair questions to ask. And in my experience, they’re very difficult to answer. Once again, the lack of clarity can lead to guessing games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-there-are-people-behind-the-code\">There Are People Behind the Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writers also need to take a measured approach when asking questions or leveling criticism. That’s because we’re not just talking about a product. Human beings make WordPress, and we must consider the impact of what we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the fuzzy details on leadership and decision-making make our job more difficult. We may hypothetically posit a question. But taken out of context, it could read as being hurtful or unfair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic rules of journalism apply — even if you’re not technically a journalist (Full disclosure: I’ve had no formal training in this area). But suffice to say that it’s best to stick to the facts. Making accusations without proof or passing along hearsay does you no favors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when criticizing a feature or decision, we should include a detailed explanation. Instead of simply stating that a theme “is hard to use”, provide examples of <em>why</em> it was difficult. It’s still important to provide context — even if we don’t always get it from our subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we all make mistakes. And even the most careful writers will still face negative feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it comes in the form of an old-fashioned internet troll. But it may also come from a place of misunderstanding. In that case, I’d encourage engaging on a personal level. An honest dialogue can produce positive results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-financial-resources-for-writers-are-scant\">Financial Resources for Writers Are Scant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to cover the important issues and happenings in the WordPress community, it takes time and resources. For most writers in our space, these aren’t easy to come by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several online publications dedicated to the CMS and many more that provide at least some level of coverage. But news, analysis, and opinion aren’t necessarily what they’re looking for. Quick tips, tutorials, and plugin roundups get plenty of clicks and are somewhat evergreen. More importantly, they don’t run the risk of rubbing stakeholders the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the few outlets that do encourage in-depth coverage tend to have very limited budgets. They aren’t full-time gigs. Writers often have to piece together roles at multiple publications. This doesn’t leave much time to dig into a topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, I love having gigs at places like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://speckyboy.com/react-javascript-snippets-ui-elements/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Speckyboy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thewpminute.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The WP Minute</a>. They’ve helped me to find my voice and feel closer to the WordPress community. But I also consider my situation to be an outlier. There don’t appear to be many opportunities for a writer who wants to take a similar path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet writing is only part of what I do. I’m still a freelance web designer and that makes up the bulk of my income. Writing is a passion and (thankfully) a way to boost my bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like contributing to WordPress core, writing about the software takes some measure of passion. You do it because you love it — not for wealth and accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-journalism-is-a-unique-and-important-niche\">WordPress Journalism Is a Unique and Important Niche</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress project, software, and community are equally important. They all play a role in ensuring growth, progress, and success. A sizeable economy of users, builders, and business owners depends on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why staying informed is vital. And so much of the reporting and learning opportunities come from unofficial sources. These writers help us keep up with the news and teach us how to use new features. They’re a key part of the mission to democratize publishing. I’m honored to play a tiny part in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about WordPress isn’t always easy. There can be several obstacles — not least of which is having access to accurate information. But that hasn’t stopped the many talented bloggers and journalists out there from trying their best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, we need more people within the community who are interested in writing and more places to amplify their voices. WordPress is in a constant state of change, and it takes a dedicated group to spread the word and ask difficult questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>Want to write for Post Status?</strong> Please <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/contact/\">get in touch</a>.<br /><br />We are happy to compensate members of the WordPress community (and Post Status) who have experiences and insights to share or good questions worth exploring — about tech, business, and careers as well as the project and culture of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-12 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vertical-post-status-logo-250.png\" alt=\"Post Status\" class=\"wp-image-86322\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" /></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">You — and your whole team — can <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership\">Join Post Status</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><strong>Build your network.

It\'s still active but the <a href=\"https://builtbywp.com/#faq\">FAQ</a> says, &#8220;Our website design & development services start at $3,500 USD.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there\'s Built by WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/08/30/need-a-website-fast-let-us-do-it-for-you/\">Express</a> — where &#8220;in-house experts will build the site for you, all in four business days or less. The cost is $499, plus an additional purchase of the WordPress.com Premium plan.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no way not to see this <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/do-it-for-me/\">Do it for Me</a> service as competing with freelancers on the low end of the market, which <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/\">Matt Mullenweg</a></strong> previously <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/\">claimed</a> was not the intention of the premium site building service last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also estimated that <strong>Automattic</strong> captures less than 5% of the revenue in the total WordPress ecosystem — much less than other large hosts. At the time, <strong>David Bisset</strong> writing for Post Status, asked for more transparency about &#8220;how many customers have been acquired and new sites built on WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress market share has always been highest and expanded the most in the broadest market — the top million active websites as measured by traffic. WordPress currently has around a 36% market share by that measure, but it falls to 14% in the top 10,000 most active sites. While sites with no (identifiable) CMS are still the largest and probably easiest area for growth, it\'s logical for WordPress.com to focus on the lower end of the market rather than leave it to other hosting companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably, freelancers are going to feel the squeeze as commodified websites and website building services compete downward on price. The wisdom usually offered about this is sound: learn the price points where you can be most competitive and trade on unique value you can bring to clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A geographically localized focus, an affinity-based or purpose-built niche of features, and personal referral networks are unique strengths. There are also plenty of important, high-budget clients whose websites never need or intend to serve millions of visitors. Built your own local or niche market analysis — current market share data for WordPress doesn\'t tell you much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade ago, <strong>Chris Butler</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://www.newfangled.com/report-the-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-a/\">survey and report</a> at <strong>Newfangled</strong> for other small agencies was really helpful in <a href=\"https://www.newfangled.com/the-results-of-newfangleds-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-agencies-survey/\">getting the numbers that matter</a>. (I believe this survey was done more than once but not sustained over the years since then.)

He also shares how he has developed an approach to using technology in order to overcome longstanding difficulties with his eyesight.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this People of WordPress series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1014\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-aug-powp.jpg?resize=1014%2C627&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus playing the guitar\" class=\"wp-image-13341\" /><em>Bud Kraus</em> with his guitar\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your understanding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud has taught web design since 1998, with students from more than 80 countries online or in person. He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br /><br />But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" /><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" />Bud Kraus\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br /><br />He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person. He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global reach and meaning through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=600%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus with Josepha\" class=\"wp-image-13342\" /><em>Bud Kraus with Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WordCamp Montclair, NJ 2022</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress. He in turn is an advocate for the community around open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The software is really good, and the people are even better.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I get a sense of accomplishment whenever I launch a new or redesigned site. It’s also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world from my <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus\">talks and presentations</a>.

To better illustrate this, based on PPP data from the last 5 years, those in India may receive discounts of up to 75% on Business Bloomer WooCommerce online courses, those in South Africa may receive a 59% discount, Norway students may receive no discount, and so on. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 14:51:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: #41 – Laura Nelson on How To Create a Profitable Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=137279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/41-laura-nelson-on-how-to-create-a-profitable-newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42472:\"<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/laurora/\">Laura Nelson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is a Content Marketer at WooCommerce where she’s responsible for creating and planning engaging content for their users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to WooCommerce she worked at <a href=\"https://www.mailpoet.com/\">MailPoet</a>, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and before that, she worked at Pragmatic, a UK based WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She’s on the show to share her experience about how you can, and why you might want to, set up a paid email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I hear the word newsletter, I’m typically thinking of the information which drops into your inbox on a regular basis.

And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to share on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Laura Nelson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is a content marketer at WooCommerce, where she&#8217;s responsible for creating and planning engaging content for their users. Prior to WooCommerce she worked at MailPoet, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and before that she worked at Pragmatic, a UK based WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s on the show to explore her experience of how you can, and while you might want to set up a paid email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I hear the word newsletter, I&#8217;m typically thinking about the information which drops into your inbox on a daily basis. We&#8217;ve all surrendered our email addresses in return for some product or service. We agree to receive emails on the understanding that we can unsubscribe at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a few of these emails really resonate with you, but it&#8217;s likely that you unsubscribed from many as the content was no longer wanted. This kind of email marketing is not always viewed favorably, and it&#8217;s not the kind of technique that Laura is talking about on the podcast today. Her pitch is that email newsletters can themselves be a product? That people will pay to receive your emails, and she&#8217;s got data and examples to back it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose that the closest analogy would be people who create an online course.

We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were a play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One last thing to mention is that I&#8217;ll be attending WordCamp US next week. And as a result there won&#8217;t be a podcast episode. If you&#8217;re going to be there. I do hope that our paths cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the podcast, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast.

Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] Laura Nelson: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] Nathan Wrigley: Laura did a talk yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Laura Nelson: Yesterday afternoon. Yep. So I&#8217;m feeling pretty good today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re feeling happy. Yeah, she did a talk at WordCamp Europe, 2022. What was it entitled? What was it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] Laura Nelson: It was how to create a paid newsletter subscription in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and did it go well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] Laura Nelson: I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: So we&#8217;re gonna be talking today about newsletters. Obviously newsletters, they do seem to be all the rage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] Laura Nelson: Yeah, every so often you hear like, email is dead, it&#8217;s all about TikTok and in fairness it is all about TikTok at the moment. But email marketing is amazing way to speak to your customers or your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] Nathan Wrigley: Does the data back that up then? Reliably over the last 20 years, we can say email still works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah. And conversion rates are far higher from email marketing than they are from like, if you tweet about your product or your services. Email marketing is golden in terms of conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s interesting. Just the interface is a little bit more, how to describe it? TikTok&#8217;s a bit more ephemeral. There&#8217;s a lot going on, and there&#8217;s a lot making you wish to scroll past all of the things. I think it&#8217;s the only thing that&#8217;s been with me for 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] Laura Nelson: Exactly. People are familiar with it. They know how it works, they know what to expect from an email. I think you&#8217;re capturing people at a good time, because generally they&#8217;re not gonna open their emails unless they have time to read your email. Whereas if you are like on Twitter and you&#8217;re like idly scrolling or you&#8217;ve got like two minutes, it forces them to stop, but they might not have time to take that information in. So email, it&#8217;s nice. It sits there. If you don&#8217;t have time to read it properly when you first open it, you can come back to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:53] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. I was just thinking about that. And if I don&#8217;t log into Twitter for a few days, there&#8217;s almost no chance that I&#8217;m gonna see the things from three days ago, because I&#8217;m gonna start at the top. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you&#8217;re talking about newsletters, presumably we&#8217;re talking about a piece where people have subscribed to a newsletter, and you are then offering content to them. Is that basically the model?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] Laura Nelson: That&#8217;s right, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and you are talking about getting paid and generating revenue, and it almost sounds like it&#8217;s too good to be true. You throw together a newsletter and suddenly, you become incredibly wealthy. Of course that&#8217;s not the case. There&#8217;s probably a lot of hard work. There&#8217;s probably a lot of expertise required. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] Laura Nelson: Yes. I&#8217;d say the hardest part of this is building your list. So if you don&#8217;t already have people in your community or your audience available, you probably have to put a bit more effort into marketing. But in terms of expertise, you can write a newsletter about anything you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The example I gave in my talk yesterday was a newsletter about cats, and that&#8217;s an interest. I&#8217;m not an expert on cats, I just think cats are cute. And so, you can use them in whatever ways you want. I definitely don&#8217;t think you have to be an expert in a specific subject. If you are good at writing, or if you have interesting or unusual opinions about things, you can easily make an email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:11] Nathan Wrigley: Before we pressed record, we talked about the fact that there is a rival platform, which I think by now probably most people have heard of. It&#8217;s called Substack. And you likened what you were describing in the talk and probably what we&#8217;re gonna be talking about as a, kind of an alternative to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:26] Laura Nelson: Yes. That&#8217;s right. Substack is huge now, and I can&#8217;t remember the figures off the top of my head, but there are millions of subscribers across all the Substack newsletters, I guess you&#8217;d call them. And the solution that I&#8217;m gonna be talking to you about is an alternative to keep that in WordPress, rather than outsourcing that to a different platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] Nathan Wrigley: Is there a strong reason in your head why you would not wish to go with the, it&#8217;s the SaaS versus WordPress argument. You could have this about a thousand different SaaS platforms. But is there a strong reason in your head why you wish to do it in WordPress and not just pay Substack the fee and get on with it over there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] Laura Nelson: I think WordPress, I mean, WordPress lends itself to content. Like WordPress is where you publish content. And we&#8217;re talking about sharing content in a newsletter. And I think like this method, what most appeals about it to me is the fact that everything is in one place, and it&#8217;s familiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a WordPress website or a business that&#8217;s using WordPress to power it then you don&#8217;t have to learn something new, it&#8217;s already, it&#8217;s just there. It can be extended onto what you are already doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:27] Nathan Wrigley: The payment bit, we&#8217;ll probably unpick the payment puzzle, but is this basically a paywall thing? In other words, are you restricting content? Are you only sending out to people who&#8217;ve paid? Or is it that you embed other things inside the newsletters, you know, upsells and subscriptions that people might join and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:44] Laura Nelson: No, no, you are only sending the content to those who&#8217;ve paid. So it&#8217;s like a subscription, like you would, sign up to like a, I think you can get them for like dog and cat food, where they get delivered regularly. Then you, yeah, just like that. But instead you&#8217;re receiving content in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:58] Nathan Wrigley: So you are going to describe to us a system built where you go to the website, you&#8217;re engaged, you sign up, you begin receiving emails and if your subscription payment is cancelled, the emails fail, and it stops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:09] Laura Nelson: Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:11] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so what plugins are you using?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:13] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so in addition to like being on a WordPress website, so disclaimer, I mean, if you&#8217;re not on WordPress, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re listening to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:19] Nathan Wrigley: No, that&#8217;s probably fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;ll need like WooCommerce, MailPoet, which is an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and WooCommerce subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] Nathan Wrigley: So the basic WooCommerce to sort of bind the whole subscription thing together. You add the subscription thing on top. And then there&#8217;s MailPoet. Is there any cost to any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:36] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so WooCommerce subscriptions is $199 per year. MailPoet is free to use up to a thousand subscribers. So when you get beyond that, there&#8217;s tiered plans. But I think the lowest plan starts at around $12 or $15 per month. It&#8217;s quite reasonable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve heard, and I don&#8217;t know where this number comes from, but I&#8217;ve heard that if your email list is a thousand people, roughly you can become profitable. And what I mean by that is that you can become profitable enough for it to become an important part of what you do. And it always felt that that was like a really, quite a low number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then having tried to create email lists in the past, I quickly realized actually a thousand is pretty hard to get to. It&#8217;s difficult to get people to surrender their email address. So is there any advice that you give to people essentially to give you their email address?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah. I think what works best is honesty. Be upfront and honest about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending to them. That you&#8217;re not gonna pass on your, their email to somebody else. And when you&#8217;re going to, like the frequency that they can expect to receive emails from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s just a case of making sure that the content that you&#8217;re including in it is really valuable, offers something a bit different or unique that they might not be able to read elsewhere. I mean, that&#8217;s like solid advice for if it&#8217;s a paid newsletter or not paid. And then it&#8217;s just another form of marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend including, including a link to sign up in all of your normal email signatures, like from your Gmail or whatever you use. Use your social networks. If you have a good community on Twitter, let them know about your newsletter. Basically, plug it everywhere that you possibly can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] Nathan Wrigley: Does the MailPoet solution, does it allow you to create, so forgive me, first of all, I&#8217;ve not used MailPoet, so I don&#8217;t know how the UI works, but does it allow you to basically create a post in WordPress, which is then fired out as an email?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] Laura Nelson: Yes and no. So if you mean like a post in WordPress that you&#8217;d be able to go onto a WordPress website and see it in like the blog section. It wouldn&#8217;t work that way around. If you had published a blog post on WordPress and then use MailPoet to send an email, it&#8217;s a tick, like a widget, that you drag in and a tick that and you can include that entire blog post in your email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:45] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you create a normal blog post. Tick a box. When you click publish, it is converted to an email and sent out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Or you drag it into like your email template, and you can add other stuff around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:56] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, okay. So you could put a different header and a different footer in? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] Laura Nelson: And in the case of the paid news letter though, you&#8217;d probably, in order to get people to sign up and pay for this, you don&#8217;t want that content being available on your website for free. So you&#8217;d probably want to write the post within the email itself. So it only lives there and not elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] Nathan Wrigley: Yes, that wouldn&#8217;t make sense, would it? If it was a paid newsletter, and the content was available on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:21] Laura Nelson: But you could use WooCommerce memberships. You could guard that and make it a private post and then link to it it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:27] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So as with all things WordPress, there&#8217;s a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can add another layer to this if you want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:32] Nathan Wrigley: If somebody was to begin a completely new website. You know, they wanna talk about, I dunno, volcanoes or something. Then would you be able to do this on pretty modest hosting? Because it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lot going on. Basic WordPress, basic WooCommerce, a couple of extra plugins, maybe really cheap hosting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:50] Laura Nelson: Uh, yeah. Really, unless you are planning on adding loads of other products to your store or adding loads and loads of other content to your website. You can keep this really lean and get away with really cheap posting. It wouldn&#8217;t take much, you just need a product page really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] Nathan Wrigley: The difficulty I think maybe is trying to get people to find your newsletter in the first place. And then of course there&#8217;s the problem of getting them to separate their email and give it to you. Have you got any advice for how you market your newsletter? Anything around there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:21] Laura Nelson: Yeah. It&#8217;s funny. Someone asked me this yesterday after the talk and I, I said I could probably do an entire other presentation on this exact topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] Nathan Wrigley: Go deep, it&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] Laura Nelson: So, what I was saying earlier about being really upfront about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending, when you&#8217;re gonna be sending it. Know what you&#8217;re doing with their email address. And you just really need to show some value. So you need to make sure that the content that you are creating is unique or if you do have an expertise in a certain area, really let people know, like why that&#8217;s important to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content is all about problem solving for people. So you need to find out what problems people have. And if you can solve that in content, then let them know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that some things are going to be more of a labour of love than other things. Again if you&#8217;re producing the volcano newsletter, I&#8217;m expecting in the low single digits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] Laura Nelson: Well you know, it&#8217;s a niche market I imagine. Maybe that would be more successful because you know, you get people who are really into something like that. You know, there&#8217;s probably not a lot. I dunno, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not familiar with the volcano market. I&#8217;m not gonna lie, but, um, I kind of imagine there will be those niche areas like that, where if there&#8217;s not content being published about that or at least readily available to you, then you probably would pay. It&#8217;s like, oh yeah, I love that, and I&#8217;m really interested in that. So I would pay to receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:40] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting because of course you&#8217;ve gotta think about the person reading the content and whether volcanoes are gonna be of any interest to them, but also your ability to sustain this, is directly related to how interested you think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, if you genuinely have no interest in volcanoes and you embark on that mission, probably it&#8217;s gonna dry up fairly quickly, and so I wonder if often people in this chase the big thing, the big shiny, exciting thing only to discover, you know, what, actually on a deep, personal level, I&#8217;m not interested in this, and the newsletter dries up and falters and fails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:16] Laura Nelson: If you&#8217;re thinking about starting this up, you need to remember, it&#8217;s not just one email. It&#8217;s not just two. It has to have like longevity to it. So whatever it is, whatever topic you&#8217;re choosing, obviously you can&#8217;t possibly know what you might like to talk about or write about in six months time, but you need to make sure that the topic is either big enough or is like new things are happening in that area enough in order to sustain a long term newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] Nathan Wrigley: I wonder if this is like a perfect extension to people who are already doing things. They might have got a YouTube channel. They might have a WordPress website and they&#8217;re producing things. Or in this case here we are on a podcast. It may be that you&#8217;ve got that kind of thing. It feels like a bit of a no brainer to just add this on as a kind of value add. So you could have, well, I don&#8217;t know, content that only subscribers get, or things like that. Is that where the market seems to be leading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. You obviously can start from scratch and it, technically it&#8217;s pretty easy to do so, in that respect. But, you&#8217;re gonna have more success if you already have, you need to make sure you already have an audience. And if you already have a business, you already have a customer base or an audience that are, are listening to you, and you&#8217;re communicating with. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s an obvious, like an easy fit for established businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So if you&#8217;ve got something going already. It&#8217;s almost like a missing piece of the jigsaw if you&#8217;re not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:39] Laura Nelson: It&#8217;s not to be used to like plug your products or services. It&#8217;s not like, I guess if you were to run a, an eCommerce store and you sell products, it&#8217;s not to be used like that. It&#8217;s like a highlight of, oh, we got these new trainers in stock etc. You have to be adding something of value, like an opinion or some content that they can&#8217;t get elsewhere. I think one of the, um, examples I gave yesterday was digital downloads. Like if you&#8217;re really good photographer, you could share your photos in an email newsletter and let have access to use your photos, you know? Like on a weekly basis like, 10 new photos every week or fortnight or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:18] Nathan Wrigley: So this is subscription, which means we must decide on a subscription term. Do you typically, would you say like go monthly? Is that, is that the easiest, least friction way to do it? Sort of asking people to separate money from their wallet, monthly, annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] Laura Nelson: I&#8217;d offer both a monthly option and then a yearly, maybe it would just slightly discounted. Because it&#8217;s great. If you have people signed up for a year or they&#8217;ve committed to that year, that&#8217;s excellent. But I&#8217;d always give people the option of monthly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:45] Nathan Wrigley: My fear of offering an annual plan would be that I just dry up. You know, I&#8217;d be eight months in and I&#8217;d be, ah, I&#8217;ve got nothing else to say, and then I&#8217;ve got to think about the, the sort of refund process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:58] Laura Nelson: Yeah. If you do that, you would probably have to refund people, but offering a yearly option is something you could consider after you&#8217;ve got into the groove of creating a newsletter and you think you can see it has a longer life to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I know this, what we&#8217;ve been talking about is a WordPress thing. The piece that you described, the MailPoet and the WooCommerce bit is the way to get paid for that. Just briefly talking about alternative ways of doing that. The sponsorship bit, or the payment bit outside of WordPress. There&#8217;s things like Patreon and Ko-fi is that, an angle you&#8217;ve ever looked at or explored?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah, and like Substack. They&#8217;re all like really great platforms to use. But they&#8217;re outside of WordPress. So, I think the kind of unique angle here or for this approach is, if you want everything to be all in one place, if you&#8217;re already creating content in WordPress, don&#8217;t spend your time copying and pacing it over to a different piece of software. You can have it all like in one dashboard, basically. Ownership is a big part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Nathan Wrigley: Thorny question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:01] Laura Nelson: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:01] Nathan Wrigley: Where are the email addresses stored?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] Laura Nelson: Right? So in MailPoet, no one else can see your subscriber&#8217;s email addresses. MailPoet takes, email best practices and security very seriously. We don&#8217;t even see the emails that get sent out via MailPoet. So they&#8217;re stored on, I think it&#8217;s like your server, they belong with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:22] Nathan Wrigley: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:23] Laura Nelson: They don&#8217;t come to MailPoet at any point. They are yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:26] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s an interesting thing. And I guess you would need to be mindful of GDPR if you are storing people&#8217;s email addresses. Do you have any insight into whether those are in the database? Do you know whether they&#8217;re in an encrypted, in an encrypted form or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:40] Laura Nelson: This is a technical question that I am not able to answer, I&#8217;m afraid. At least not confidently. I think I know the answer, but I absolutely wouldn&#8217;t want to go on a podcast and tell everybody the wrong thing if that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s okay we could could look at that another time. And so have you got any good examples of newsletters where you could say, go and have a look at that one. Two or three that you think are really worthwhile where somebody&#8217;s done it just right. They&#8217;re doing really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] Laura Nelson: So the first one&#8217;s called Dense Discovery. None of these examples are actually of paid, well, actually I can give some paid newsletter examples. Let me start with Dense Discovery, which you can pay for, but they handle the payment a slightly different way. It&#8217;s more like a tip based system. Like if you enjoy this, you know, become a friend of the newsletter. But from a content perspective, I would pay to receive Dense Discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they offered it up as a subscription, I would do that. Cause I tip on a regular basis. It has a really good balance of the guy who&#8217;s created the newsletter called Kai, like his opinion, and his take on what&#8217;s happening in the world. There are some lovely resources for like design. He often shares like an illustrator and their work, as well as some like handy tools for like productivity at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind like a nice, a nice blend of content. And it&#8217;s really regular. I know when I&#8217;m gonna receive it. It&#8217;s the same time each week, and I know the quality of the content&#8217;s gonna be really, really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:01] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just pause you there, and just go on a bit of a segue and we&#8217;ll come back to some other ones in a minute, because that just suddenly occurred to me. There&#8217;s something a bit meta going on there, because he&#8217;s not asking for a subscription, but what if you had an email newsletter, which was a, the sort of upsell for the paid newsletter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] Laura Nelson: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] Nathan Wrigley: If you know what I mean? So the newsletter itself contains a proportion of the content. Is that a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:24] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely. And actually the next example I was going to give. I&#8217;d like to like add to disclaimer it, this isn&#8217;t of my interest but&#8217;s I can see it&#8217;s done really, really well, which is why I&#8217;m gonna mention it. It&#8217;s called Daily Coding Problem. So it uses this paid newsletter technique really interestingly. It&#8217;s basically they send like a coding problem. It&#8217;s designed to help programmers prepare for technical interviews. And if you are only a free subscriber, you don&#8217;t get to see the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:53] Nathan Wrigley: Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:53] Laura Nelson: Uhhuh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nathan Wrigley: That is intriguing. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of like using the annoyance style isn&#8217;t it? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:58] Laura Nelson: So I mean, if you&#8217;re really confident with these, maybe you don&#8217;t, maybe you don&#8217;t need to see them, like the mystery. Yeah, you have to become a paid subscriber to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. So throw something out there. It&#8217;s a bit like if Wordle didn&#8217;t give you the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] Laura Nelson: I know. How annoying would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: Well, you&#8217;d pay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:16] Laura Nelson: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] Nathan Wrigley: And you&#8217;d get the answer every, every day. Yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating. So I mean that&#8217;s really unique isn&#8217;t it? But presumably most of it is about just the kind of stuff that you would ordinarily put on your website. You just make sure that the content&#8217;s really good, but you indicate they&#8217;ve got to the end of this newsletter, but there&#8217;s more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:32] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:32] Nathan Wrigley: You could find out more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. And another example, um, which I mentioned yesterday actually was Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:38] Nathan Wrigley: Oh. I pay for Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:40] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;re newsletter subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. I hadn&#8217;t connected. I use the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] Nathan Wrigley: But it is a newsletter, is and he got me through the newsletter. You&#8217;re right. Go on, tell them about Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so Jack&#8217;s Flight Club, as we just heard, is, it&#8217;s a really popular one, uh, in the UK and Europe. And it sends you like error fairs and cheap flight deals. But if you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber, you don&#8217;t get all of the deals. And when you get the free version of email, they tell you which deals that you missed. So it really plays on that, like FOMO, like, you know, you&#8217;ve missed these incredibly cheap flights to Canada. You didn&#8217;t get that because you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s right. And the interesting thing about that one is. That&#8217;s kind of opened my eyes up actually about where the price points may be. And maybe, maybe Jack is different, but it&#8217;s about if I recall, I think I paid about $40, something like that per year. So it was not really a lot. If you spread that over the, you know, it&#8217;s like $3 80 or a month</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s really not a significant amount, but presumably if Jack, I&#8217;m guessing there is a Jack, I don&#8217;t know, but presumably if Jack&#8217;s into the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. This</p>\n\n\n\n<p>is incredible… a million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:52] Laura Nelson: He&#8217;s got a million subscribers, million plus, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:55] Nathan Wrigley: We can work the maths out there. Okay Jack&#8217;s doing well from newsletters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Laura Nelson: Jack&#8217;s doing alright. Well, it&#8217;s the success of a newsletter that enabled him to take it to an app and, you know, grow this beyond just email content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:06] Nathan Wrigley: I want to be Jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:08] Laura Nelson: Yeah, me too. I bet he&#8217;s on a yacht somewhere lovely, right. He&#8217;s not looking up cheap flights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] Nathan Wrigley: He&#8217;s no longer looking, but that really illustrates it perfectly. So it was something most people probably don&#8217;t care about flights at all. They&#8217;ll just look the flight when they&#8217;re going on holiday but here&#8217;s me, I&#8217;m intrigued. I want if there is a cheap deal out there. So it&#8217;s got me on that niche thing. Like the coding chap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I don&#8217;t know how long it took me. I think he was probably giving me the free one for six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know what he also did, which was curious, which was actually the hook. He offered a 20% discount in one of his emails. So that&#8217;s another interesting pricing strategy. He had his annual price and then he, for a week only, I think it was 20% off. That was the, the fishing rod that I happily bit on. And, and I think he&#8217;s got me for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can do that with this, and I&#8217;d recommend exploring things like that. Just jumping back to your question earlier about how to get paid subscribers. If you already run a successful newsletter, you can drop in the bit about you having a paid newsletter too, give &#8217;em a little taster of what they&#8217;ve missed or what they will miss if they don&#8217;t pay to subscribe and yeah, it got you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:17] Nathan Wrigley: It works. And interestingly enough, I am pretty difficult to get, and yet he got me. So it is, it is about the niche I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Nathan Wrigley: Well, let&#8217;s talk about the actual email itself. So we open up the email. Are there any sort of top tips about the way you should present things? I mean, are we looking for bright and colorful? Are we looking for more words than images? Are there trip wires that prevent the email clients from opening things? Because there&#8217;s just way too much text and it truncates it. Just give us what the email actually should be looking like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] Laura Nelson: Well, I mean, it does completely depend, like what you&#8217;re including in it. I wouldn&#8217;t be, if you are selling a like long form content style email, don&#8217;t be afraid of including lots of words. Because that&#8217;s what people are paying for. But in terms of spam filters, if you&#8217;re offering a paid newsletter subscription, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have any issues because it&#8217;s usually things like the word free and like capital letters, lots of exclamation marks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] Nathan Wrigley: Emojis in the subject line, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] Laura Nelson: Emojis in the subject line are okay, as long as they&#8217;re not overused. Yeah. Basically emails like don&#8217;t overdo anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:20] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] Laura Nelson: A good, combination of yeah, different things that works well. In terms of layout, I mean, just take a step back and think about what you&#8217;d like to read. If it&#8217;s a big wall of text, would that entice you to read it? I mean, some people maybe, but not no. So, and you can format the newsletter to look how you want. So you could add spaces, you can add some images, you can use columns if that&#8217;s better for your content, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] Nathan Wrigley: The last time I was fiddling with email, I think we&#8217;re still stuck in tables. Are there big constraints still about the way that you can present things? So obviously on the web, our own WordPress websites, we can literally put anything anywhere, pixel by pixel, more or less. Are we confined with emails still? I mean are we still thinking about email clients from the year 2004 as a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:06] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Well, I mean email&#8217;s tricky because it will look different according to different email clients, and Outlook is forever a bug bear for those who create emails. But if you&#8217;re using email marketing software, I mean, I can only speak to MailPoet, and I&#8217;m not just trying to plug here. It&#8217;s just the one I&#8217;m most familiar with. Their templates are already fully responsive. Their templates are tested on all the different email clients. So you can kind of be pretty confident that unless you&#8217;ve gone in and really messed with that, they&#8217;re gonna work in most email clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litmus is a great tool if you&#8217;re not sure. Email on Acid to test your emails, to see what they&#8217;re going to look like on Outlook, on Gmail, all the big email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] Nathan Wrigley: And how do they work? You send Email on Acid an actual email and it then tells you, it gives you a rating or things to improve and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:54] Laura Nelson: It will show you how they look across the different email clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:58] Nathan Wrigley: Tell us about the actual UI, about how you build email. I&#8217;ve logged into all sorts of services. Typically there&#8217;s a bunch of modules for want of a better word, a bit like in Gutenberg with blocks now. So you drag in a, an image and you could drag in a couple of columns and put the image to the left, and text to the right. Is it what you see is what you get kind of builder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Yeah. It is a WYSIWYG builder. It doesn&#8217;t use Gutenberg but I know the MailPoet team are looking to explore that option. But the email itself is a WYSIWYG editor where you drag and drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:30] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s familiar? You&#8217;ll be right at home. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:32] Laura Nelson: I don&#8217;t like describing things as easy because I think different people have different perceptions of what&#8217;s easy, but this is the easiest email editor I&#8217;ve ever used, because it is simply you drag it and you drop it where you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:46] Nathan Wrigley: Do you get an opportunity to inspect it before you commit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] Nathan Wrigley: So it will send you a version you can inspect make sure the links are all working and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] Nathan Wrigley: And does it check that stuff as well? So in other words, it will see that for example, you&#8217;ve overused images, Nathan. Stop with the images volcanoes. Or that there&#8217;s too much text typically. Does it give you any metrics about, what is that called even? Because I&#8217;ve seen that before, they do some sort of test in the background and give you a rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] Laura Nelson: Like a readability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:15] Nathan Wrigley: Something along those lines, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] Laura Nelson: It doesn&#8217;t, no. I think because the way MailPoet&#8217;s built and we don&#8217;t see your email content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:23] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s interesting because it&#8217;s your WordPress site. So it&#8217;s your email. So it&#8217;s not phoning home any to any third parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:29] Laura Nelson: It&#8217;s not but that&#8217;s a pretty interesting idea. Maybe I&#8217;ll pass it onto the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:32] Nathan Wrigley: Oh okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:33] Laura Nelson: That would be useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:34] Nathan Wrigley: Can I take credit for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:35] Laura Nelson: The feature will be called email read, readability by Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:40] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s great. Okay I&#8217;m happy with that. So Laura, just before we wrap up, where&#8217;s the best place to find out about, well, in this case, MailPoet, where do we go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:48] Laura Nelson: MailPoet.com. If you head to the blog, there&#8217;s some really great articles there about email marketing in general. How to build your list. There&#8217;s even a blog post about creating a paid newsletter. Like what my talk was on yesterday. Fantastic resource for all things email marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:04] Nathan Wrigley: Well Laura, well done for getting through your talk at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:07] Laura Nelson: Thank you. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:08] Nathan Wrigley: A nice relief and, very happy to have you on the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] Laura Nelson: Thank you so much for having me.

Varghese is founder of FlyingProxy, a competing company, and identifies himself as a &#8220;performance enthusiast.&#8221; He accused the plugin of &#8220;cheating Pagespeed and other tools&#8221; by hiding JavaScript files from loading when users test their sites through popular performance testing tools. The code uses an odd set of obfuscated names for the testing tools, which drew his suspicion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese neglected to mention in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GijoVarghese_/status/1563097754322501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1563097754322501632%7Ctwgr%5Ebf97b211fb13920391541b64137000b5ea1edc0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-optimize-plugin-accused-of-cheating-pagespeed-and-other-performance-testing-tools\">tweet</a> that this is what happens when one of the plugin&#8217;s settings under Minify > JS is set to defer JavaScript. There are two radio button settings but they are confusing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first radio button allows users to defer selected JavaScript files. It says the files will be loaded asynchronously (not the same as defer), and then it also says that users should select the first radio button if they want to exclude scripts from page speed tests. It is not clear how the scripts will be loaded for the user or for testing sites. Excluding is not the same as deferring, so in this case the settings UI is somewhat misleading and should be more clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The second radio option is for users who are simply looking to defer all JavaScript. If one selects <em>&#8220;Defer using JavaScript (Use this method if you require support for <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp\">older browsers</a>),&#8221;</em> it should do exactly what it describes in the link:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>If the <code>defer</code> attribute is set, it specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> Even though the UI says it is deferring all files, WP-Optimize never loads the JavaScript for performance testing sites. In this second option, the exclusion of testing sites happens without the users&#8217; permission. If users had wanted that, they would have selected the previous radio button and explicitly identified which scripts to exclude.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese left out some significant details in his original report, but it was accurate in that certain settings are misleading about what they actually do. He demonstrated this in a follow-up video where there is no manual entry of any scripts to exclude and the second radio option is checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re providing an option for users to cheat testing tools,&#8221; Varghese said. &#8220;Also, using names like &#8216;ighth&#8217; for Lighthouse and &#8216;tmetr&#8217; for GTmetrix clearly shows what they&#8217;re trying to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most of the users try disabling and enabling different features to see which one is increasing the speed/scores in testing tools.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese contends there is no need to do things differently for testing tools and humans, as this can be confusing for site owners. His allegation left out significant details and implied that all of this is hidden in the code. It is for one of the settings but not the other one. The interface implies that you must enter scripts manually to exclude from testing, but this is also misleading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-Optimize <a href=\"https://getwpo.com/wp-optimize-completely-rejects-false-allegations-of-gaming-page-speed-results/\">published a public response to the allegations</a> today, but has not revealed any of the results from the code investigation they completed. Instead, the company cited a video created by Peter Wilkinson from <a href=\"https://diviengine.com/\">Divi Engine</a>, who claims that users must manually enter scripts to make testing sites exclude them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkinson is quoted as concluding that &#8220;Gijo Varghese has used deception to promote Flying Pages and Flying Press&#8221; in bringing this issue to public attention on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In reality (from my research) WP-Optimize do not &#8216;cheat&#8217; Pagespeed tools when you install or Minify your JavaScript,&#8221; Wilkinson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To &#8216;cheat&#8217; the tools, you need to manually add the JS files you want to asynchronous load to a setting that clearly has the label &#8216;Use this if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix…)\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the case. The easiest way to test is to install the plugin, turn on &#8220;defer all JavaScript,&#8221; and then view the source to see that performance tools are excluded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WP-Optimize&#8217;s public response to the issue did not include anything from their code investigation, I contacted them again. Their deputy lead Venkat Raj was not available to answer why other settings in the plugin silently remove JS for performance testing tools with the click of a radio button. Joe Miles, head of strategy for the company, shared the last information he received on the issue from Venkat Raj: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The advanced setting used in the allegation is actually useful to find out whether the essential js/css files are actually slowing down the web page or not.  This feature is by default, turned ‘off’ and only enabled by advanced users who know what they’re doing.<br /><br />&#8220;You may use this feature if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)<br /><br />&#8220;Independent scripts are for example &#8216;analytics&#8217; or &#8216;pixel&#8217; scripts. They are not required for the website to work. &#8216;<em>Use this if you have a completely independent stylesheet or would like to exclude stylesheets from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)</em>&#8216;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies to the first radio button. The second button does not have any indication that it will turn off all scripts when using testing tools &#8211; nor does WP-Optimize&#8217;s team seem to be aware that it is available with the click of a radio button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miles could not confirm whether this is how it is intended to work or if it is a bug. He also could not account for why the names of the popular testing sites were obfuscated in the code, but said the original developer &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work for us as it&#8217;s open source code repurposed from elsewhere.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, we believe this is a distraction from the false allegations, and what matters is that the UI is very clear for the settings are for, so users aren&#8217;t deceived,&#8221; Miles said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raul Peixoto, author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/\">Fast Velocity Minify</a> (FVM), the plugin from which WP-Optimize copied the code, said he can confirm that this code was part of FVM but said it was not used in the same way:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The purpose of such code on FVM was completely different than the one on WP Optimize and furthermore it required for the users to manually enable this option via wp-admin (it was disabled by default).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of that code was to selectively test the impact of new scripts or plugins in performance, and help developers decide if they should refactor, remove or replace heavy plugins or scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This existed on FVM to answer questions like these:<br />“I have a production site and my performance is low. What would be the performance if this plugin was simply not here, but without actually removing it from the site for regular users yet?”<br />“What would the performance be if I could defer all scripts, or specific scripts that are not currently compatible with defer, before actually doing that change for everyone?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An official explanation regarding its use on FVM is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-are-some-scripts-not-loaded-for-speed-testing-sites/\">available in the plugin&#8217;s support forum</a> as of this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I suppose that the developers hired by WP Optimize did not understand what this was doing on FVM or under what settings, or perhaps, they may have felt tempted to use it as a hack,&#8221; Peixoto said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We should also carefully remember that at that time, there were still no web vitals metrics publicly available, so using something like this would have yield better &#8216;measurable&#8217; results, thus offering a product advantage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piexoto said he &#8220;felt compelled&#8221; to remove this code two years ago because of how often it was abused by developers who were cheating on tests for their clients:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Fast forward some time, and I realized that some developers were actually using this to cheat on the tests for their clients, so I felt compelled to make the decision on FVM 3 (already late 2020) to remove this feature, which was met by a lot of protests of angry developers when their clients started complaining that their scores went down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried at that time, to explain that having a good score was not the same as having good web vitals metrics, but eventually I gave up on that, as some people cared more about the test results than the actual performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After FVM 3 release, I am basically just maintaining it and doing small bug fixes when reported, as I have to focus on other things. I have removed that function and fixed a couple of bugs that were pending on version 3.2.9 and pushed an update, so thank you for referring this to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For whatever reason, UpdraftPlus chose to merge this code into WP-Optimize in 2020 and, as reported yesterday, hasn&#8217;t touched the code since. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What appeared to be a black and white issue yesterday is a more nuanced situation. WP-Optimize&#8217;s implementation of FVM&#8217;s code is poorly documented in the UI and misleading about how the scripts are loaded. It can lead site owners to activating it without being advanced users, and historically has a high potential for abuse. When Varghese discovered it, he exposed it in an inflammatory way, feeling certain he had found wrongdoing because of how inexplicably obfuscated the code is. This compounded the issue but started a broader, important conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should users have this kind of easy access (two clicks) to turning off scripts for performance testing tools? How can developers in the same industry better communicate about potential harms to users that they see in others&#8217; products? What kind of code documentation requirements should agencies implement to prevent a situation like this where code needs to be investigated over the span of days in order to find out what it is intended to do?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 22:41:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Post Status: Naming is Hard: Social and Schema Images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=113879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://poststatus.com/naming-is-hard-social-and-schema-images/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:799:\"<p>This was <a href=\"https://joost.blog/social-schema-images-naming-considerations/\">a neat post</a> from <strong>Joost de Valk</strong> back in July where he did some thinking out loud about the challenges of naming in <strong>Schema.org</strong> image standards to distinguish between featured and poster images on social networks:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I’ve been playing a lot with Schema and Social images recently and one thing has become clear: we need better naming of these images and we should probably improve the Schema.org image standards a bit.

UpdraftPlus acquired WP-Optimize in 2016 and claims that the tool &#8220;has everything you need to keep your website fast and thoroughly optimized.&#8221; A <a href=\"https://getwpo.com/\">commercial version</a> is also promoted through the free plugin that is hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tell me, UpdraftPlus, how I&#8217;m supposed to continue trusting your company with my clients&#8217; backups when you use these deceptive and fraudulent practices?&#8221; one customer Adam Lowe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamslowe/status/1564325514319466503\">said</a> in response to Varghese&#8217;s discovery of the plugin not loading JS for performance tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow, all I can say is what an utter disappointment,&#8221; WordPress agency owner and developer Brian Jackson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of alleged deception is eerily similar to a <a href=\"https://metacoffeedata.com/manipulating-google-lighthouse-results-scam-by-upwork-freelancer/\">scam</a> reported by someone who contracted a performance freelancer on Upwork who artificially manipulated Google Pagespeed results. Others participating in the discussion on Twitter compared it to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Volkswagon emissions scandal</a> where the carmaker was found to activate its emissions controls only during laboratory testing in order to meet the EPA&#8217;s requirements after a violation. The vehicles on the road emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides while driving, as compared to how they performed in the rigged laboratory tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese and several other participants in the conversation concluded that this is why site owners should focus on what real world users are experiencing, instead of performance tool test scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hopefully they wonder why their CrUX report data (or better, RUM data) didn\'t budge.

They don&#8217;t expect that a plugin will be hiding JS files from performance tools. Tricking the tests has eroded WP-Optimize&#8217;s credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow. If true, this is as short sighted as it is inexcusable,&#8221; UpdraftPlus customer Johnathon William <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnofhousejohn/status/1563216460737966080\">said</a>. &#8220;And it makes me wonder if I can trust their other product, UpdraftPlus, which I use to backup several client sites.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I contacted UpdraftPlus and lead developer David Anderson said the company was not aware of the issue with the code but related some of the backstory. UpdraftPlus was briefly in talks with the author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/\">Fast Velocity Minify</a> plugin about the possibility of combining forces, in which he would maintain the minification module within WP-Optimize and gain more users. Ultimately they could not come to an agreement, but during that time WP-Optimize&#8217;s developers forked and adapted Fast Velocity Minify under the GPL. The developers who worked on that adaption are no longer with the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the commit to our own source repository, 2.5 years ago (Jan 2020), the commit was labelled &#8216;Resolve &#8216;Add CSS and JS Minification GPL code from &#8216;Fast Velocity Minify&#8217; &#8211; Part 6&#8242;,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Part of a series of initial merges of code that was re-factored to be cleaner and use our coding style preferences (but not change any functionality). So the apparent intention of the merge of those lines was to bring over refactored code without at that stage making any changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;According to the commit history (i.e. the &#8216;git blame&#8217; function) no changes have been made to that code since, i.e. it is as-imported. (The history for WP Optimize is public in WordPress SVN too).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a cursory examination of the code, Anderson concluded that his team may need to reexamine it, as they were not aware of what was added two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I try to trace that function through the code within the plugins, the intention&nbsp;<strong>on the face of it</strong>&nbsp;appears to be that if the website visitor is a &#8216;bot,&#8217; then code that is pointless for bots won&#8217;t be carried out,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However having said that, 1) the bot names look to be heavily obfuscated/redacted, which is strange (why?), and&nbsp; 2) there are plenty of more obvious bots that aren&#8217;t listed there, such as the Googlebot itself. If that function was being put before me for review today, I&#8217;d certainly question why that is so. I can&#8217;t mind-read myself back 32 months ago, but, I remember it as being a long series of large patches, so it wasn&#8217;t being closely analysed on a line-by-line basis. We knew that we had identified FVM as a good plugin and our main focus was on adapting it to our structure and style, and those were the things I personally was looking at as the final reviewer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, UpdraftPlus&#8217; development team was not aware of this code until the Twitter thread was published over the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad to have it brought to our intention,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The associated code comment on a related fragment in its original source that it&#8217;s intended to prevent unnecessary requests for bots, but on a closer examination than that line got at the time, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll want to look at, as it does look questionable/strange, and we&#8217;ll be doing that by assigning it to a team member who&#8217;s our expert in JavaScript optimizations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anderson also said that if the JavaScript optimization experts cannot find any legitimate purpose for the code, &#8220;it will certainly be removed,&#8221; with a clear and unambiguous disclosure for the reasoning behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, UpdraftPlus has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/code-under-investigate-in-wp-optimize/#utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_content=social\">published a notice</a> in the plugin&#8217;s support forum to inform users that the code is currently under investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To be clear and set users’ minds at rest: the code in question is not dangerous, a virus, an infection, useful to hackers, or anything of that kind,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The allegation is that its only purpose in existing is effectively to cheat on speed tests. Such code, if so, does not belong in WP Optimize and we will remove it with a new release. Our products’ integrity, and our customers’ trust, are essential for us (and deliberately putting things in open source code that compromises that is, frankly, a stupid thing to do).&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 23:15:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Sonic Sphere and Empyrean Gate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=60315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://ma.tt/2022/08/sonic-sphere-and-empyrean-gate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1266:\"<p>If I had to pick one reason why I&#8217;d suggest every person should attend Burning Man at least once, it would be the art.

For example, the header uses the Cover block featuring a gradient image with the focal point picker set at a certain point. Site identity and navigation are organized within a group, followed by a Media and Text block header section. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon install and activation, Pentatonic delivers a good experience for users. Clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes users to the Site Editor with the front page loaded, looking nearly identical to the demo for the <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-free/\">free version</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic comes with 17 block patterns that users can easily mix and match to create their own unique pages. These include patterns for About Us, Call to Action, Featured Content, Sidebar, Music Podcasts, 404 Header, Archive header, Default footer, Footer with three columns, Default header, Recent with blog sidebar, Post header, Header with buttons, and more. Each section on the homepage can be recreated using a pattern on other pages or repeated/rearranged on the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes 11 templates and eight template parts, allowing users to make customizations to the 404 page, blog single posts, search results, post content, and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pro version of the theme includes access to custom blocks, such as a playlist, case study, skills bar, masonry, popup video, and more. The <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-pro/\">demo for the pro version</a> has a sticky music player at the bottom of the page, promotional popup video, podcast playlist, and other custom media additions that bands and artists may require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic has been optimized to respond well to all screen sizes and looks just as good on mobile as it does on desktop. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pentatonic/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> where you can preview all the patterns and check out a preview of the whole theme in action that strongly resembles the demo hosted on Catch Themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:38:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: Tech Roundup for the Week of August 22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/tech-roundup-for-the-week-of-august-22/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5489:\"<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">DigitalOcean\'s acquisition of Cloudways • Stop saying &#8220;Gutenberg!&#8221; • Build Mode Live with Brian Gardner and Sam Munoz • One week left to submit a style variation for TT3 • Cool Tool of the Week: Munir Kamal\'s Editor Plus </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-development-around-the-web\">WordPress Development Around the Web</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A glimpse of what’s going on in the world of development and design in the WordPress space.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/digitalocean-to-buy-web-hosting-firm-cloudways-for-350-million\">Huge news in the hosting space</a>! <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> is set to acquire <strong>Cloudways</strong> for $350 million (USD).

We need to have a consistent vocabulary on how we talk about these things to each other and to stakeholders so we all understand what we’re discussing. I’ve gotten into the habit of saying “the Block Editor” when talking about the new interface for page building in core, but I never thought that we could also break down explaining the various parts to full site editing as well.

A bonus for users of this plugin is that there are also a ton of great video tutorials on how to extend Editor Plus to do almost anything.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:46:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Daniel Schutzsmith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"WPTavern: James Koster Shares Design Explorations that Transform WordPress’ Site Editor Into a More Visual, User-Friendly Tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://wptavern.com/james-koster-shares-design-explorations-that-transform-wordpress-site-editor-into-a-more-visual-user-friendly-tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4026:\"<p>Automattic-sponsored designer James Koster has a vision for taking WordPress&#8217; Site Editor from its beta awkwardness and transforming it to become a more visual and user-friendly design tool. In a recent post titled <a href=\"https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/\">Revising the presentation of key Site Editor features</a>, Koster identifies unbalanced feature weighting as a critical design flaw that is negatively impacting users&#8217; experience with the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The Site Editor is a powerful tool, but the user experience lacks some coherence and a sense of hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template management and editing has central focus, despite the fact that it’s a product area that has proven difficult for some users to interpret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impactful features like style and menu management are hierarchically relegated, and consequently deliver a sub-optimal UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I’ve been ideating on how we might present site editor features with more appropriate weighting, so that the overall experience feels more like a design tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of dropping users directly into editing the homepage, Koster contends that the Site Editor&#8217;s design should be updated to become a &#8220;navigable frame&#8221; where users can select from a menu of features and styles on the left. This is a radical improvement over the current experience, which feels like walking into a room with all the lights on and multiple features competing for attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The combination of the site frame (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">Browse mode</a>) and one-click editing helps to obfuscate some of the aforementioned confusion around template editing,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;Now you simply browse to the page you want to update, and click ‘Edit’.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another idea Koster explored is a view that makes it easier to understand the interaction of styles and templates. The UI is much cleaner and drastically reduces the cognitive load for users who are struggling to grasp the concept of templates in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity and homepage configuration options haven&#8217;t found a place in the site editor yet. Koster proposed bringing them into the editor in a similar fashion to how it was previously presented in the Customizer, with live previews.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Koster also proposes organizing features like templates, template parts, reusable blocks, and patterns in a &#8220;Design Library&#8221; section, presented via a grid of thumbnails that would open the edit view. This would bring a new level of organization to a set of tools that are currently scattered throughout the site editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few highlights from his explorations. Although Koster articulates many of the Site Editor&#8217;s current pain points, his designs present an elegant solution for each. Check out the <a href=\"https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/\">full post</a> to see all the videos and other ideas for organizing features in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disparity between the current experience and Koster&#8217;s mockups is like a night and day Cinderella style transformation. It&#8217;s a powerful example of how thoughtful design can really solve problems. His explorations received positive feedback from those eager to see these designs implemented in Gutenberg. Koster said his next step is to prepare some simpler prototypes for collaboration on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ideas are still formative, but with some pruning we can get things into a shippable state,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;My next step is to refine and prototype a more stripped-back version, and take that to GitHub for wider thoughts and feedback.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:13:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Post Status: A Taxonomy of Access Control\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106756\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://poststatus.com/a-taxonomy-of-access-control/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2978:\"<p><strong>Bruce Schneier </strong><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html#comments\">thinks this idea</a> from <strong>Ittay Eyal</strong> is brilliant and broadly applicable. Since I like pretty much everything Bruce says (that I can understand) I tried to get my head around this and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">the discussion it spawned</a> in <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Post Status Slack</a> with <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Rowley</a> and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">JJJ</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bruce\'s summary:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The paper is about cryptocurrency wallet design, but the ideas are more general. Ittay points out that a key—or an account, or anything similar—can be in one of four states:<br /><br /><strong>safe</strong> Only the user has access,<br /><strong>loss</strong> No one has access,<br /><strong>leak</strong> Both the user and the adversary have access, or<br /><strong>theft</strong> Only the adversary has access.</p><p>Once you know these states, you can assign probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (someone hacks your account and locks you out, you forgot your own password, etc.) and then build optimal security and reliability to deal with it. It’s a truly elegant way of conceptualizing the problem.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of it more like this, since it\'s how most people actually operate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Secure:</strong> Only I have access (as far as I know)<ul><li><strong>Strong Secure:</strong> Proper strong, unique passwords, 2FA</li><li><strong>Weak Secure:</strong> Weak, reused passwords, no 2FA (OK for trivial sites that require a login, bad for your bank account.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Loss:/Lockout</strong> No one has access</li><li><strong>Shared:</strong> I and designated others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Leak:</strong> Undesignated, unknown others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Theft/Breach</strong>: An adversary has access <ul><li><strong>Theft and Lockout:</strong> An adversary has access and may have broadly leaked or shared access with others, but I am locked out.</li><li><strong>Theft and No Lockout:</strong> My account has been hacked but I can still get in. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid Sharing/Leaking with strong secure accounts, and the probability of theft/breach is much, much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html\">A Taxonomy of Access Control</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 14:42:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: Woo Stories, They are Everywhere\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-stories-they-are-everywhere/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:383:\"<p>Every product or site WooCommerce builder has a story to tell whether they are a developer, designer or anything between. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

Giving, making, creating&#8230; Looking at the search results for  &#8220;Make WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;the firehose&#8221; of Make WordPress Slack where the #docs channel was having their weekly meeting, Dan and Ny look at the wide range of options there are for new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, that\'s a step deeper in.</em></p><cite>Dan Knauss</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring and organizing Meetups is a topic that comes up again. That\'s where Ny feels she has been given the most and most enjoys giving back. However, there are barriers to getting people engaged with the WordPress project — and to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan asks what needs to be done to reach younger people. Ny talks about the barriers from a BIPOC perspective, where sensitivity to history and personal stories matters. Dan relates that to an inner city gardening project he volunteered with that had an all-white leadership team. If contributing is a privilege, how can we help elevate more people to that level of privilege?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also covered:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How does the older open source culture of contribution (not) translate to the contemporary culture of the &#8220;creator economy?&#8221;</li><li>Dan\'s initial experience with trying to onboard himself in #docs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"Cloudways\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-8 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"sponsor-wpengine\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/cloudways\">Cloudways</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Cloudways</strong> </strong>is proud to sponsor Post Status.

And some of the discussions that are going on about what it, what contribution means or could mean. And, um, Yeah, how\'s that sound? What\'s what\'s yours? What is it? What comes to mind when, when you hear that word in the [00:01:00] WordPress context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, I guess, uh, the same it\'s, it\'s the same when I hear it in like, you know, outside in life contribution means giving back. It means helping, it means providing, um, and, uh, you know, it\'s the same in WordPress. So definitely down to talk about this today, and I\'m very interested to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s the core part of the, the project that is the oldest, um, feature of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oldest foundations of it, that\'s very, very open source, very old, um, old part of open. As Matt has said in, in some talks, like give a penny, take a penny kind of, kind of ethic. Um, really kind of going back, I guess, to like Linux and the seventies [00:02:00] and early and earlier generation. And I wonder sometimes if like after millennials or so if, if that\'s things have changed a lot and that\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understood. There\'s kind of a, a reciprocity there. You use the software, it\'s free. It\'s open. Um, how are, how can you, the more you get engaged with it as a user, as a developer, um, someone maybe profiting from it. How, how do you give back and does that, does that just happen naturally through the relationships that arise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or not. And how do we move really? How do we move the, the project forward? And, um, I was just looking this morning. Like if you, if you, um, I was, I was just Googling make WordPress. So there\'s the whole make.wordpress.org, um, page where you get the list of all the core core teams and, um, [00:03:00] If you search for make WordPress, you get three ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, first for WP engines, WordPress page builder, wordpress.com WordPress page builder element, or for WordPress, create it with Elementor, um, the create and build language. So, uh, most people these days, um, and, and they\'re targeting what people wanna do. Uh, how do you just make something with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create and build. But I\'m looking for the old school. How do I contribute back? Where, where the you\'re budding developer designer, just helping, like helping out. We\'re always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Um, and there, what you can give back goes into all these teams that, uh, we now have a performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn\'t changed a ton. It\'s, it\'s rare for them to add. So we got the core and that\'s really like the fundamental. Thing here, if we don\'t move word breast core [00:04:00] forward, how much does anything else matter? But there\'s so much else people can give and do that really is essential too. You don\'t don\'t want to deemphasize that design mobile mobile team is now been more explicitly defined as that\'s open source that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not, um, that\'s not something that is tied to jet pack or.com. And you, you wanna work on iOS and Android apps, Java objective C swift. Um, that\'s a, that\'s a whole nother section accessibility. Polyglots multilingual, uh, translation, WordPress support, uh, support forums. What,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, what stands out to you the most out of all of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what do you think? Like, not what\'s most important, but, um, cuz that\'s subjective. Um, which one would you be like most interested in contributing to? Yeah. Which one do you think speaks to you the most? When you read through the list? [00:05:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I was, I was, I\'ve been thinking about that. So then there\'s documentation and that\'s where I\'ve been trying to kind of learn, figure out how to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s kind of where it, it isn\'t that easy. It isn\'t that easy. maybe, you know, some people or if you have a deeper connection, but from that straight outside in it\'s it\'s tricky documentation, themes, plugins, community. Training test TV marketing, CLI WordPress CLI the VP CLI uh, hosting tide, open verse photos for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s really a lot of different skill sets that could be attractive. And a lot of things you could do, but to be honest, the, um, my, my experience is, um, I haven\'t really done like. Contribution in the form of little patches and bug reports and stuff since way back, like, you know, they\'re still using tra have you, do you have much SVN experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s what we were all using like 20 years [00:06:00] ago on source project. WordPress is still using. Um, so, so yeah, there\'s all these, all these different teams that are maybe attractive to different skill sets you may have or different people, um, May have, and, um, core is really at the center of it. And there\'s all, all these other things orbiting around that, um, or orbiting around the community and, and serving it or around mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, finding your way into it, I think is, is. Is the trick. Um, once someone gets interested in, in doing that and bringing, bringing new folks in and smoothing the onboarding, um, is probably, um, something we need to pay more attention to. It\'s tough. I, Brian mm-hmm Brian cords was, was writing about [00:07:00] that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did he, um, So he, he talks about his experience. I\'m, I\'m kind of doing the same thing. Try, can I put in a few hours a week, I\'ve been trying to follow, just look at the docs program, you know, cause writing, editing that\'s mm-hmm, , that\'s probably the easiest thing for me. I\'ve I\'ve done little bug reports and patches and, and things before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go back a long way. So SVN or, you know, was something I was using way before GitHub existed get was a thing. Um, but it\'s, it\'s. It\'s quite amazed of, of things and a lot of customs and etiquettes and rituals, parts of the culture to, to understand, um, to get started. So I feel like there\'s like a long watching, reading, learning, asking questions, maybe getting mentored, um, phase you have to go through, um, have you taken a look at like the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would make [00:08:00] WordPress slack at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. And I\'m going to be completely honest. Um, I will eventually, I am just in so many slack channels right now. I don\'t think I can. I don\'t think I can possibly take on that one. Um, I\'ve heard it\'s it\'s a lot. I, I just cannot do it. I\'m in like work slacks. I have like my mentoring slacks that I do official mentoring with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have like slacks I was in before I, um, got. Um, tech and I still help people there. I just, uh, if I join one more, I think my head will explode. Yeah. But please enlighten me to what usually goes on</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> here. Well, I\'m not an expert, I\'m trying to figure out the same as you and, and, and Brian and, um, yeah, I think the reality is, is yet they call it the fire hose for reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s probably, one of the busiest slacks and consistently for so long, this major, um, Of [00:09:00] information and cooperation. Um, so it\'s daunting, it\'s intimidating to, um, to look at how to get into, um, but it there\'s there\'s method to the madness and what I\'ve learned, just kind of following along and looking at, at things in a, in a pretty traditional way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I assume the. Other teams work like this, but like docs. Um, we have a, um, a meeting every Tuesday morning at this time. So 8, 8, 8 am. I\'m kind of following, um, on my phone here and people kind of check in. I can make it, I can\'t make it. Um, melanic cap is, um, one, the leader there and one of the leaders and you\'d probably like her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a ump developer. Um, who\'s kind an advocate. For PHP as well. Who\'s been doing docs for a long time. So you developer literacy is really important if you\'re gonna write [00:10:00] docs and guides for, for things that directly deal with that. But there\'s so much else you don\'t have to be. You don\'t have to have any particular code depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much other documentation going on. Um, and that\'s probably starting to overlap some with the training materials that are another team. That\'s a. Newer thing that will help onboard people, I think, to have training and then also mentoring happening all these meetups that are relatively new, um, community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Is that I\'m not sure what group that\'s what if that\'s happening under the community team? I think that\'s all that\'s under the training team. Mm-hmm uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> what the meetups,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> oh, that you\'re talking about. Yeah. They\'re make they\'re they\'re coming out of the core. So they\'re, there are, um, Hannah tab. For this somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Organizing the meetups, which is what I\'m doing in [00:11:00] Columbia, South Carolina. And I always say the city and not the state and Charlotte, North Carolina, mm-hmm um, falls more under community. We\'ve been all over there. Yeah. Trying to get things, uh, settled for it. Um, that\'s that\'s my area of export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expertise, but it\'s still really, really hard. Um, , I I\'ve, I\'ve organized a lot of things and this might be the hardest honestly. And I don\'t know if, if it\'s, you know, because it\'s so specialized or what, but, um, still really excited. And I just I\'m, I just can\'t wait to, you know, have that set up as my contribution and like spread it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s like my goal for it. Yeah. That</p>\n\n\n\n<p>would</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Def that would be under, under community. Um, Yeah, it\'s actually is I guess, something you could get into and start doing in your own, um, in your own city and a lot happens outside of slack, outside of, um, Outside of this, but that there\'s the community team. And mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, I was speaking of, um, the, the newer meetups that [00:12:00] are sponsored by learn, um, WordPress. So there\'s, there\'s probably some increasing overlap between community and training, which is a good thing. There, there are all these meetups that are happening as virtual. Um, there\'s a schedule, there\'s a calendar on here where people like, um, um, People who are directly involved in working on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, uh, Nick Diego, I saw I had had one coming up, um, uh, will be doing live workshops so you can go and get, get some knowledge from, from people who are directly working on, um, on newer parts of, of WordPress and. so some of that is higher, higher level stuff for, um, developers, designers, and some of it is oriented towards people who might be really new to using WordPress in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So training\'s [00:13:00] close to mentoring and close to community building. So that\'s kind of a neat area where, um, where people can. Brought in and, um, connected. And I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, , that\'s like step in mm-hmm um, for a lot of people, um, I noticed that, so we have this weekly thing that Daniel Chut Smith is doing, um, for us where he\'s rounding up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, What\'s going on and what\'s catching his eye, uh, design and development. And this, his last Roundup was mostly stuff coming from.org from make, create your first app with Gutenberg data. So using react. Um, so Adams Linsky put together a nice tutorial. That\'s showing you how to do that. That\'s a link to, um, developer, the developer section of word, wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme builders, Figma [00:14:00] of building a workflow from Figma Figma to your block theme. You\'re trying to create, that\'s a learn WordPress online workshop. So that\'s, that\'s one of these things I\'m talking about. That\'s a meet up. So, um, you can sign up and, and do that. There that\'s an intermediate level for an audience of builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people who may not be high, um, Deep into code, um, high level development stuff. That\'s okay. This is, um, working from Figma to your block template. Are you, are you doing anything, any front end stuff like that, or mostly have these database backend projects you\'re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m doing everything. But, um, mostly right now I am working with the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mostly when I talk to my mentors and they want me to show them, like, I always get the question. Uh, can you show me what you do at work or a day in the life of you? Mm-hmm and, um, I don\'t show them my [00:15:00] calendar. I don\'t wanna scare them away, but, um, uh, usually it\'s front end work with them, um, because that\'s what, you know, they learn first and most are interested in, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, I have not gotten away from front end work because that\'s the first thing that newbies wanna see. Oh yeah. How it works in WordPress. And I think, uh, WordPress is great for front end development. So that\'s my way of trying to get them into the community as well. So I throw in my community stuff like, Hey, you know, we\'re gonna have meet up soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to come and learn more about the community and that\'s my sales pitch. And that\'s how I, that\'s how I get. That\'s how I\'m getting people into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s great to see that there\'s so many levels like, yeah, we\'re gonna reach out to builders, to people who are totally new to it, to people are maybe doing freelance or agency work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I was hinting earlier, like when you, if you search for this, like the way that, the way that a lot of companies, including, um, wordpress.com and automatic or. [00:16:00] Presenting WordPress to the world is to the creator economy and to, to people, I just wanna build something. I wanna start my business online. I, and, and their first thought is I don\'t not to understand anything about open source or that there\'s a community behind that or what, that, that, there\'s this, uh, culture of contribution and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a long, that\'s a long way up later. Mm-hmm and , I wrote something where I, I, I feel like, you know, we really have. Embrace that. And I see that happening on the marketing level, on the commercial side to a lot of WordPress companies. Um, and I, I even noticed like, as, as the.com, um, I, when they did their first price change, I got the bargain and I up upgraded my longstanding account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a.blog blog and a bunch of other sites there. And. Um, you can, there\'s the marketplace there. You can install and do a lot in.com. Now you can install Elementor I\'ve not seen that [00:17:00] before. So you could, you could pop that in on wordpress.com and start building with that if you want. And they\'re very oriented towards a, a builder, um, creator economy approach, but getting people inside is like the key thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, however you come, however you come, come, as you are. I think like that needs to be more of. Our approach. And as cuz people aren\'t gonna, the average person, isn\'t gonna go to.org, the make thing there, and look at these core teams and, and, and go like, okay. Yeah. I, I see where I fit. Like I, you and I would, would struggle with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s gonna, it\'s gonna take weeks and, and months to probably get, um, to get comfortable. And that\'s, that\'s cool. That\'s fine. That\'s how you build relationships, but it\'s not. It\'s not like on the instant gratification level of, let me build my site today, which you wanna do as quickly as as you can. Um, [00:18:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think it\'s even, um, even for people like me who will sit down and take their time, um, when things are presented to them, It\'s so much to go through sometimes depending on what you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like you said, like it\'s not an easy thing to jump into. It\'s it\'s making that time too. I know, like for me right now, I get asked every week, like, how are you doing everything you do? And sometimes, I don\'t know, but, um, like. I think it\'s easier for me to still contribute because like, I, I didn\'t go into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, Hey, I have to make myself fit to one of these. I went into this as, this is what I already do. This is something I\'m good at, how can I connect this with WordPress? So I think that\'s an easier way. And then like that allowed me to like, okay, I can make time to, you know, set this. I have a partner helping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Ken, yeah. Elliot is helping, um, well, he\'s the mastermind. I\'m helping him. Um, and, um, I think that\'s a easier way, but I agree with you a hundred percent. [00:19:00] Um, that\'s, you know, just when you were reading them off, I\'m like, this is a lot. And then when you get into them, it\'s like, you have to break it down and that\'s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if we have like more. I guess people like me or you cuz you did it too. When you talked about how, you know, you\'re a writer and documentation probably would be your strongest point and you\'ve done some of it before. I think people getting people like us to talk to people and say, well, this is how we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would definitely help people a lot because it\'s a little overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it is. And yeah. Well, if what I, what I found is that it\'s probably your own sense of, um, my own sense of in, in, uh, you don\'t want to be ask of the dumb question, but, or, you know, You have to put yourself out there. So they\'re very encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like who\'s got questions who needs help. You know, you, you, people will take the time and, and show you. And I\'ve, I\'ve got like an accumulated list of tabs and, and links where I need to, I need to take some time and watch this UN WordPress TV. Right. I need to read through this and figure it out. [00:20:00] I, um, a couple weeks ago, I, you know, figured out how they\'re using good Gutenberg on, um, GitHub, a little deeper and, and how to, um, How to submit, um, changes on, uh, there\'s there\'s documentation, that\'s written into code, uh, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and sometimes it\'s wrong or, or changes. So you have to, you have to actually commit, um, changes to comments that are embedded in PHP code somewhere. Um, Things like that there\'s a wide range of, of stuff, but how all these workflows and things work and it just takes some time to, to learn. And it\'s, it\'s pretty satisfying once you figure it out and you are like, okay, I fixed, I fixed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is. Yeah. And in the process you might find some more bugs or things and stuff like that to, to put in. Um, but just a little here and there is, is, um, is really a good thing. [00:21:00] Um, I, I. People on the whole are, are really welcoming. It is, it is just getting past that fire hose and here, here\'s what I need to forget all that other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what I need to focus on. And it\'s probably cool doing the meetups or mentoring, which, um, is gonna become more and more a part of the training and community. I, um, I don\'t have, I\'d like to get more details on this, but I, I see SFA has been, been saying things about mentoring as. Becoming a more explicit form of contribution, mentoring, how to do word camps and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm , and that they, there is probably some mentoring program coming down the line, along with training. So if you\'re doing, you want to go and do, um, a meetup, um, tutorial of some kind or do that in the context of your own meetups, totally contributing. And then I that\'s, that\'s probably accessible to a lot of people cuz most of the work is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gonna be, I would assume relationships and [00:22:00] stuff like in your community. So you don\'t like, you don\'t start from slack, you don\'t start from, from all that. That\'s kind of where you go to maybe get support. And, um, the main, the main thing is really the people stuff. So if that\'s, that\'s what turns you on and, and motivates you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, that\'s totally essential contributing out there in. Real life relationships, um, locally where you\'re, you\'re starting. How\'s that going with? Um, Greenville and, um, or green wait, Greensboro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> no, not Greenville. Um, not Greensboro. Um, I think you\'re, you\'re getting me nice or green mixed up with those I\'m I\'m joking. Um, so char Charlotte and Columbia. Okay. I don\'t know where Columbia .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Go ahead. Sorry. I used Greenville in my head like Greenville, South Carolina, you know, I used to live [00:23:00] in Raleigh mm-hmm Durham, chapel hill area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually. I don\'t know if you know that area that well, Carrie and Carrie and table mm-hmm . Yeah. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I, I really love that area actually. Um, uh, you, uh, now there was a, uh, Greenville, uh, WordPress meetup for a long time. Um, and I think like a lot of people in Columbia, even though there was one in Columbia at one point, I think a lot of people in Columbia had to go to Greenville for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may be thinking about that. Cuz Greenville, I think had a longer, a one that lasted longer than ours. In Columbia. Um, but we\'re right now, if we were to start one in Columbia, to my knowledge, cuz I always check out Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, the big major cities, to my knowledge, we would be the only one in the state right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna double check on that. But the last I checked a few months ago. Yeah, we would be the only one. So I. It definitely would help. And like, we really want to spread the knowledge because Columbia\'s in the, in the middle of the state. Right. That\'s why I chose Columbia, not just because I [00:24:00] was from there, but it\'s in the middle of the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm, , we\'re an hour and a half to almost anywhere in the state, maybe two max. And so if people have to make that drive, which, you know, if they can, that\'s fine. If they can, we still wanna do it, uh, in a way that will. You know, semi virtual and recording recorded. So we\'re setting that up as well. Um, cuz we know South Carolina is very rural and we don\'t have great public transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, it\'s really going to help a lot because it\'s going to reach all throughout our state, which is not known for tech at all, Charleston and Greenville, more Southern Columbia. So. It\'s going to help a lot and it\'s going really, really well. Um, we have a place, um, we have food, uh, so many different companies reached out to me because they saw what I was doing and wanted to help goad wants to feed us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, my company master WP wants to feed us and master WP is actually sponsoring our, um, sponsoring us and taking care of our venue. Um, we [00:25:00] have people offering to send us. Things to give out to newbies. Um, I have Courtney Robertson, which is, she\'s been such a great help who has just offered to give out so many learning materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, I ju just the outpouring of support and then we can take that and spread it. It\'s just been, it\'s been a community effort, so it definitely meetups are definitely community. I see why it\'s under that label and I\'m just so excited. Like I\'m going to like spam everyone\'s Twitter when. You know, get up and running and we have pictures and video and things like that because, um, I think, you know, I agree with Josepha Josepha is really, really great to talk to, and I love how she answers questions and it\'s always very transparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it\'s, it\'s awesome that she\'s going to expand that because we can definitely take these materials and, you know, help with that and make sure people can do it in their states. Maybe their states don\'t have any work camp meetups or WordPress meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There\'s probably, uh, It\'d be interesting to look at a, a Pinboard, you know, [00:26:00] map of, you know, where we, where there\'s activity and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are very established and been around a long time. Some come and go. The, I know the local Edmonton one. Um, yeah, pretty much ended just around the time I, I moved here. There\'s one in there\'s, one in Calgary. Um, and I\'ve talked with some people there about, about all that. Um, you know, it, it\'s a, it\'s a takes a lot to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get things, uh, rolling again, but there\'s wherever you go, there\'s kind of an existing WordPress builder community. I, I, I sense there\'s a lot of people freelancing or, and there\'s a bunch of agencies and my, this was true even when, before WordPress was that adopted probably at that level. And I was doing more with, um, with June law and some other DRAL and other, other CMS, um, related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That a lot of people just get in to scratch their rich and build something. And, and then they [00:27:00] start doing that as a job and maybe they develop an agency or something. And so there\'s, there\'s a bunch of people who are like an unorganized, the lump and proletariat of word press, who are like, uh, they\'re not organized into, um, into a, a regular meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Um, but the potential is there mm-hmm , maybe it comes in and goes at at times, cuz there there\'re people who would fit the kind of WordPress professional or the line between the hazy line amateur and, and professional and doing this for myself and or which often turns into this is my job. Um, but it\'s, it\'s often secondary and I think that\'s an, that\'s been tough for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project. And I wonder if there\'s, if there\'s a, that\'s kind of where contributor language gets gets complicated. And I wonder if we should like focus more on creativity and creation and there\'s all these people who are sort of [00:28:00] on the outer edges, who, who are very versed, inward press or using it in some significant way, but they haven\'t really connected deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the community. And they\'re definitely contributing in the sense of, um, teaching and informing and expanding the market and expanding the brand, but, um, how they find their way into. These other, um, layers of the onion towards core contribution. Um, it\'s, it\'s tough cause you don\'t wanna make it sound like, well, what you\'re doing isn\'t worth as much mm-hmm um, cause it it\'s as they\'re all different, but to drive things forward, you do need people to come in who get more of that kinda leadership level to organize, meet up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentor people, um, submit patches, um, get involved in, [00:29:00] in actual software development, which yeah. Is hard not to, not to privilege. Cause that\'s really a key, that\'s what we\'re all using. That\'s what either falls behind or, or innovates and yeah. What do, what do you think about that? Do you, are you think there\'s ways in our language that can be kind of offputting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s like this inner circle of, of people who give back and are. Are you adequate is it can maybe be an easy feeling of, uh, of inadequacy or imposter syndrome that\'s RI and, and things, and, and that language can kinda land heavily on, on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, especially, you know, that\'s something that goes beyond tech, but, um, when we\'re talking specifically about us right here. Yeah. That can be off putting you. You have to think. Um, I do a lot of community service. because that\'s just how I am. That\'s just how I was raised. That\'s just me as a person, but I\'m smart enough also to acknowledge [00:30:00] it\'s tough to get people to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it\'s tough. Um, that\'s something that\'s drilled that was drilled into my head from, um, From a young age. And we talked a little bit about that on one of our other podcasts, like how American slavery, like is affecting people to this day. And it\'s like, there\'s no way anybody in my family from the oldest members, my great aunts to the youngest, my little baby niece, none of them would just sit and smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I told them I was working, doing anything for free outside of C. Help. So , and it\'s like, it doesn\'t even have to be that deep for a lot of people. People are just not working for free mm-hmm, , we\'re in a very capitalist society. Um, we, things cost money. You know, things are high right now. Um, but again, not even getting that deep, it\'s just hard for some people to just work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also for people who want to do it time. Time is such a big constraint. So you may have people that are out there. They\'re like, I wanna do this. Yeah. But I [00:31:00] don\'t know how I wanna do this. And I don\'t have the time. And now these people are telling me that I\'m not enough. If I\'m not doing this, man, I\'m not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I see how it can lead there. Um, I, I, I definitely see that. Um, sometimes, you know, I, I it\'s, it, it is, it does seem like that at times, but it\'s just going to depend on you as a person, like stuff like that. Won\'t bother me personally, because if I can\'t do something, I can\'t do it. Yeah. I don\'t have the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t have the time, but I, I get it. I definitely get it. Um, I, I\'m not sure though how. I\'m not sure how to pull people in, who may be feeling that like it, they may have that imposter syndrome now. Um, is there just like extra reassurance? What do you think? What, what do you think could be clarified in the language to get those, to, to kind of pull those people back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the more channels, the more way, ways in the, the better off you are, if it, I feel like in the past, it\'s [00:32:00] like, that\'s the only thing, like.org make page. You either figure out how to get into a team here, you hit the support forum. You, you, you find you come in through some local group. Um, there are only a couple, couple ways to do it and it, uh, it is all in this open source contribution code, committing focus, and that\'s become less and less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was alwa that\'s always, always been a subculture and it\'s become probably more and more of one. um, I think younger generations too, are in a totally different space in because it\'s social, um, realities, like, I don\'t know how much we\'ve really addressed that. I mean, there are long term prolonged economic contraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, not everyone\'s doing that. Mm-hmm well, emotionally. With stable income and employment. Mm-hmm [00:33:00] you can\'t assume stuff like that there, it we\'ve been through the most stressful. Yeah. I, I don\'t know if we\'re really through it, you know, like you turn on the news and it people all around the world. And even in, in places that are, are fairly affluent it\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more stress and tension in, in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people have lost, uh, friends and loved ones either, you know? They\'re no longer living. Um, that happens normally, but we just pandemic. Um, there\'s but there\'s so many, especially as you have a community to ages and, and goes along. I, I think a lot of us who\'ve been in there a long time. Um, there\'s time of life things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I, it would be more sensitive to that all. And, and what you\'re saying too about. there\'s cultural and, and definitely racial differences that I think are hard to see from the outside. You\'re making me think of, um, mm-hmm, how the, a [00:34:00] good metaphor for this is when I, one of the things I did, I did a ton of, I lived in a part of Milwaukee that was, um, and otherwise it\'s very second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe people would say an apartheid city that has some. Entrenched in difficult problems and living in one of really the only area that\'s, that\'s fairly mixed and, and diverse is volunteerism is a key thing there. And it\'s tough. People don\'t have necessarily have a bunch, but there\'s this huge. They don\'t necessarily have the means or whatever, but they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s just such a drive to do community projects together and fix stuff. And gardening became more and more community gardens and stuff like that. Victory gardens. Yeah. Well, when I first started doing that, I was, um, I was doing it with, uh, uh, a church that had an interesting history. And so we had mostly African American kids coming to the summer program and, and trying to make a.[00:35:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of vacant lots where stuff has been torn down or burned down over the years and in my neighborhood there. And, um, trying to build a, make a garden and, um, this same, it, it it\'s, it wasn\'t so much the work for free, cuz we, it was all hitched up to, um, You you come and you work on this, you get paid a certain kind of gift allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we like try to explain banking and like walk down the street to the, the local bank on Martin Luther king drive. And like, this is how money works and like save a little. And , uh, give a little back and, and think about what your long term plans are for what you want to get. It was, it was honestly very white, middle class kind of skiing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>very good in very good intentions, but the first barrier is, um, these are kids who have like zero, um, [00:36:00] there in that area. Um, Their, their experience is all urban for, um, probably one or two generations. But before that down the Mississippi deep south, not a good agricultural experience share, you know, share cropping, you know, extended forms of Neo slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, until grandparents, parents came up in the fifties, forties, fifties, and got the last of the good industrial jobs before that all went, went in part. Um, so, mm. I realized and read some things. Um, I never read something. I can\'t remember who it was, but there was a, there was a local guy and then someone else rare, uh, voices of African Americans who got on the land and were farming got, you know, as free farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people came all the way up here in Alberta and did that Canada. And it\'s not the typical voice. And they talked about how hard it is to do. [00:37:00] Things like with the land, from an African American perspective, cuz there\'s such an alienation from it some of the time. And so these kids, oh yeah, they would not wear, like they didn\'t have grungy clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would wear like their best white brand new shoes. Like, you know, they didn\'t want to get messed up. It was really hard to get people like, get your hands down in, in this. And then like, remember kids would say like, you all look like a bunch of slaves. Like this is a huge barrier. Here cuz there\'s not an ability to imagine us working and doing this free labor in any other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like who\'s in charge, the white guys like, like, yeah, it totally looks, it totally looks that way. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, yeah. Yeah. It that\'s a good, that is a good way to put that. Sorry, that that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really story. Cause you can express that in a way that is accusatory. and make, you know, make us feel really bad, but, um, but it\'s totally valid and, and [00:38:00] there was a disconnect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way I found around that was like individual relationships and getting like over a couple years and getting to know some of these kids is they were growing up and like they in doing other things with them, like I found a, a bunch of the young men, um, like they never went over to east side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s dangerous. You can\'t go over there and there\'s nothing there that we would be interested in and, you know, broadening people\'s sense of their own freedom and capacity. Yeah, you actually, we can go over here. There\'s some cool stuff and food you like and, um, people who, uh, are friendly. So it, I think that kind of everyone does that everyone has their little comfort zone that probably needs to be expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, those walls exist, cuz people have been hurt or they\'ve, um, or there\'s something in their history where they see this as a wall that is defended and is dangerous to push [00:39:00] or they, they sense on some level like this is gonna, um, this isn\'t what I should, this isn\'t for me, this isn\'t my people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just huge that\'s people stuff. We have to find, find ways to make many ways through and in. Um, cuz if you keep trying something that doesn\'t work, that turns people off, it doesn\'t matter how right. You think you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, you\'re right on the money with that. And. just relating that back to WordPress. Imagine those kids that you were, uh, you know, trying to get to do that with. And they\'re like, God, like not saying, this is their attitude, but say they walked away with that saying mm-hmm they were trying to get us to do free labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were trying to get us do free work. That\'s crazy. And then they. um, they, you know, they get older and they learn code and they learn tech. And they\'ve heard that tech is just this, this freedom and it\'s this place to make money. And it\'s just like, you can elevate, I can elevate my life and they get to tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing they see is people saying, Hey, if you wanna be a [00:40:00] great person in this community, you need to do some free work. They all like what? Like they might freak out like what in the world? Why is everybody want me to do free, free labor and, um, that\'s, you know, that\'s just relating that back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s it\'s sometimes that\'s. A red flag to people. It\'s definitely a red flag to me. Um, because also people are still exploiting people of color women. Um, people who are disabled, they are still getting exploited for low wages or free labor to this day. So that\'s still something we have to look out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve been asked to do free labor many times, and I\'ve had to politely tell people like, no, I\'m not doing that. Or, you know, and depending on. What the situation is, maybe talk to others, like what\'s going on. Like I have to teach my mentors not to accept like, well, this job, they really gonna gimme the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, okay, me an exposure and experience. And then one day I\'ll be a big developer. No. Do not let people do that to you. That\'s like, I, I always tell people like, no, [00:41:00] you, you deserve to be paid. Now you deserve to be paid fair and adequately. So we don\'t have to go back too far. It\'s happening today. Um, so of course people are calling it out more and people are looking at it as a red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate that people see it as a red flag in WordPress. Uh, some people. Inmate WordPress and giving back. And then I hate that some people just, you know, don\'t have the time and they\'re turned off by, you know, phrasing about it because it\'s, it\'s a privilege to have free time. Honestly, these days, isn\'t it, it\'s a privilege to be able to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I never forget. And that\'s, that\'s something I always tell people as well, like, you know, you don\'t have to. You don\'t have to thank me. Like people are always like, oh, thank you for this like that. I don\'t, you know, you don\'t have to thank me. I, I acknowledge that, you know, it\'s just a privilege for me to be able to do this for you and that throws some people off, but Hey, it knows what it is, but we, I don\'t know how to bridge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially as a, as a woman of color, who\'s been asked to do free things as a woman, as a woman of color, as a [00:42:00] person of color. I get it. I get it. I definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> get. I, I, I was really glad when I, I think it was Josepha my first contact with hearing someone say that it\'s a privilege to contribute. Um, and I hadn\'t really thought about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that does that\'s good language, I think, because it, it gives honor to that role and that capacity, but it also understands that that might not be. An individual is at, at that time, then I think you have to extend yourself and go further and, and look at who is underprivileged or who lacks these privileges and how can we raise them up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we open doors? Um, and that that\'s, what\'s cool about the mentoring and, and the community stuff. Cause I think that\'s, that\'s what it does, you know, get it will help. It will help. There are other ways to, to give back and. [00:43:00] And it\'s, it can take years it\'s years of relationships and, and growth where, um, that that\'s what\'s needed to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can\'t, you can\'t what we\'re saying here. You can\'t just treat people like cogs. Like they\'re not all in the same category. They\'re not the same time of life and they\'re not the same people. And when you really know, get to know them, um, they\'ve unique gifts and capacities and what they\'re okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. With doing. um, at the moment and it\'s okay for everyone to say, and they, they, they need to, like, I need to, I need to step back. I need, um, I think we\'ve been, there\'s been so much more, um, recognition of that. Um, mm-hmm , uh, someone was tweeting the other day of like, they\'re just too much coming at. \'em too much stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re gonna, they\'re gonna give their, um, word camp ticket to someone else. And. Step back from going there. And, um, and a lot of people are [00:44:00] really supportive of that. Like, yeah, it\'s tough. Uh, tough call maybe, but, um, it\'s okay to it\'s okay to say, you know, I I\'ve hit my limit here. Um, mm-hmm .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That. Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna backtrack. I think that that\'s a great way. That would be a, a big help to helping people letting them know it\'s okay. That needs to be more clear if you can\'t do this right now. It\'s okay. Like you said, like, you know, Joseph said it\'s a privilege and you know, letting these people know, like, um, that doesn\'t mean you\'re not privileged if you can\'t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that\'s just not your time and that\'s, and that\'s completely okay. Right. And I, I like that. I like that a lot. And I, I really like that. I think also another big thing. We need to get people to see the value mm-hmm and giving back. Because again, like what\'s the value. If I can\'t make money, if I have to like take time out of my life where I\'m missing with my family or my friends, what\'s the, what value do I have to, some people like, just knowing it\'s going to [00:45:00] improve the life of someone else is not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s okay though. It\'s okay. Um, but how do we get people to see the value in this? I think community seeing people like me, who, you know, I could not, I could stop giving back tomorrow and be okay and go do other things with my life. But I don\'t wanna do that. I like giving back. It\'s valuable to. . I have a lot of things I value about giving back, especially in this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I stand up there and I talk about it and I tell people and I give to them, honestly, I think that\'s the number one thing I\'ve seen in my life that makes other people wanna give. If they can see the value that other people are getting, that isn\'t tangible, nobody\'s handing me money to do any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so I think being a, a beacon of that helps, and I think I wish we had more people, but it\'s, it\'s hard if you\'re, if you\'re doing all of this and you\'re giving your time away, it\'s hard to be like, you know, the poster job for that as well. Um, right. We a lot of people have families. I don\'t know what I would do if I had children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I would probably just [00:46:00] scrap \'em to my chest. One of those little baby vests. I like those. Yeah. I used to do that in front of you. Yeah. Oh, I love those. I would just scrap \'em to my chest and like, I guess we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> around and talk. I\'m glad to be through that kind of, um, yeah, my, my younger two daughters are, um, on finishing high school now, so it\'s pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s on their own, but, uh, yeah, that was, that was tough. That was interesting. I was the home parent. Um, and at one point, yeah, they were like, mm-hmm um, four girls they were mostly there with me and yeah, the two close together. Um, yeah. It\'s uh, well freelancing and doing neighborhood projects. It, it was, um, it was a lot and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm it makes you, it makes you sensitive. the fact that you need to, you need to understand people in their context and so that, like you don\'t mm-hmm so you can kind of help on your end too. You don\'t ask too much or that, you know, you know, how to, [00:47:00] how to phrase, um, you know what they\'re, they\'re just some conditions like you understand like, oh, this is, isn\'t a good, this isn\'t a good time or a good person to, to ask to, to help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or. Or maybe they need, you know, just knowing what the needs are and where you can be supportive to. Um, yeah, just the, the more you get deeper into individual relationships, I think the stronger and more, um, sensitive like community is the, like those go together, the strong and sensitive . Cause you\'re, you\'re aware of each other as individuals and, um, that holds things nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that made me, I was one. The last thing I, I was thinking while you were saying that there, there are so many, I think there are so many things people do or don\'t do that. Some things need to not be done. that, that contribute so [00:48:00] much. And we know it and, and sometimes it there\'s other forms of recognition that are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like yeah. If the, if WordPress cord doesn\'t move forward, everything else fails. And there\'s like, there\'s a level. um, mm-hmm of focus and need on that, that that is is unique, but then there\'s stuff that\'s farfield from maybe any, any teams that is so important in the ecosystem. And, um, uh, a guy, everyone I think has nothing but prays for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin O Hashi who, um, who like Kevin O Hashi, who does the, um, uh, WordPress benchmarks? WooCommerce too. Have you ever looked at those? Uh, there\'s kind of neutral third party deep, um, uh, analysis each year of, um, performance on load testing and, and a bunch of other stuff of, of hosts. Who, who, um, partner with them who say like, yeah, here here\'s our, here\'s a free account [00:49:00] and all of our tiers test them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, never go through those and, and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have, um, I have, did I do last year? I have, I have, I I\'m like, I\'m just going back in my mind, but I have, and I think that is really, really, really awesome. That does that. I\'m so sorry. I hear</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> from people a lot about, about that. Like that\'s a, that\'s a major service because there there\'s a lot of data poverty in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your plugin isn\'t in the re.org repo, like what do we know? What, what, what do you, what do we know about that whole, um, part of the market? And if you are in it, it\'s very limited. What, what data you get out, um, hosting, you know, going way back has always been. A pretty murky place for are these real reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Jen . Oh man. So this is like the [00:50:00] one he\'s got the one, um, the one shining beacon of reliable, trustworthy stuff. And as, uh, And he, the contribution is largely in what he doesn\'t do, which is take money or sponsors in. Um, I, I forget what is, what the, what the revenue model there is, but this is, this is one guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this isn\'t some growth oper organization. Um, it, those are really difficult things. The things we need to subsidize or help that, um, are. Kind of have a regulatory effect that help protect the space and the commons, um, because they don\'t aim at massive growth and they aim at a giving you a really honest signal on, um, you know, how are, how are these hosts doing one, one compared to another, what do you get for this, [00:51:00] this price point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. They, um, it\'s good for them. They, they know where they stand and how they\'re, how they\'re doing. I\'m sure they have their own data, but it\'s a huge incentive to, um, to compete where we want them to . Um, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of different things like that. There\'s just certain personalities who give back a ton on, um, social media or in, um, their willingness to, to teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. Yeah, I don\'t know. Do we recognize that openly enough? Um, and I think people doing stuff for the love of it is a huge privilege and it really, it is really is gratifying when people say thank you. So, um, we should do that more and thank you for starting meetups. Interesting. coming on this, on this podcast and, and being a, um, a unique voice in the, in the C.[00:52:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Uh, you\'re so welcome. Thank you, Dan, for having me on here and agreeing to do a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> no, I didn\'t agree to that. depends on what it is, but yeah, I\'m looking, looking forward to meeting all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, you picked the song. We\'ll see. I don\'t know. It\'s pens. Who\'s watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ll give you a list. I\'ll give you a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> God love. Uh, yeah. I don\'t know nothing by Madonna. I remember bad memories of a friend at a, um, student union at Marquette university who, uh, crazy guy. I don\'t think he had even been drinking, but he did, um, Papa don\'t preach and acted it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, he ended up playing down on a table or something and yeah. Yeah. He was having a, having his baby. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh, now I gotta do [00:53:00] Madonna. I gotta show him up. okay. No Madonna just make me a list of no, the nose. No Madonna. Okay. I have that. I\'ll</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> write that down. probably, and Tom waits. I love Madonna. Tom waits.

The consensus was “yes it is,” although we’ve certainly included many WordPress-adjacent or partnered companies on our (updated) <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/acquisitions/\">Acquisitions</a> page. The <a href=\"https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx\">number-filled announcement to investors</a> and <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/619704647/files/doc_downloads/2022/DigitalOcean-Cloudways-Acquisition-Infographic.pdf\">infographic</a> from <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> make it clear they know they are buying (or rather getting deeper) into the WordPress ecosystem by acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The acquisition of Cloudways expands DigitalOcean’s serviceable market within global SMBs and increases options for <strong>digital agencies, eCommerce sites, bloggers, freelance developers and builders hosting on WordPress</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) and, according to <strong>W3Techs</strong>, it powers 43% of all websites on the internet.”</p><cite>&#8220;DigitalOcean to Acquire Cloudways&#8221; • bold text added for <strong>emphasis</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>DigitalOcean is embracing its role as a WordPress host and pivoting to define its market as, well, <em>us</em>. The bold text above highlights a large part of our membership and the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Big emphasis on SMBs.</strong> DigitalOcean sees itself expanding to gain small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in its customer demographic, and acquiring Cloudways with its WordPress and other open source eCommerce customers achieves that.</li><li><strong>Cloudways fills a big gap.</strong> There’s no easy button within DigitalOcean itself for setting up a WordPress site or anything else, but their 1-click apps are the latest progression toward something like that. It’s just not likely to appeal to most people in the low-end market <a href=\"https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_wordpress_bmm&_keyword=digitalocean%20wordpress&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eCTLbvWw706hdVQiD8CFN5sup_3G_RMowCw_QPCtG5icj3v7gGg7ORoC4ukQAvD_BwE\">in its current state</a>. DigitalOcean marketing is still locked onto startups and developers too. I imagine all this will change if Cloudways is brought in as a SMB customer-facing easy-button.</li><li><strong>New Competition.</strong> Focusing on less-technical end users and the people who build their sites will put DigitalOcean in direct competition with other WordPress-focused Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers or hosting panel middleware like <strong>ServerPilot</strong> — which only works with DigitalOcean — and <strong>SpinupWP</strong>. Even more so than Cloudways, SpinupWP is host-agnostic — any server with a public IP and (currently) <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 20.04 or 22.04 will work with SpinupWP.</li><li><strong>Will DigitalOcean drop Cloudways’ support for competitors?</strong> In addition to DigitalOcean, Cloudways can be used with <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Vultr</strong>, and <strong>Linode</strong>. Many of us wonder if that flexibility might go away now. If it does, that’s a wasted opportunity. Post Status Member <strong>Kevin Ohashi</strong> optimistically (and I hope rightly) <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C1WDQ9W05/p1661371977299379?thread_ts=1661260653.084159&cid=C1WDQ9W05\">opined nothing will be changed</a>: “If the customer isn\'t going to choose you, might as well still make money off them.”</li><li><strong>The terms “Build” and “Builder” are a large part of DigitalOcean’s messaging</strong> about the acquisition. In fact, the company’s mission is defined this way, in the context of the acquisition news release: “DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world.” This sounds a lot like WordPress’s mission updated for the era of (increasingly low/no-code) website builders (the software and the people). It’s also rather different from DigitalOcean’s main public-facing messaging which is still focused on startups and developers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Some interesting numbers from DigitalOcean:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DigitalOcean and Cloudways have been close partners since 2014.</li><li>Cloudways has approximately 50% of its customers on DigitalOcean servers.</li><li>This acquisition increases DigitalOcean’s high spend customers by 18%. They will come away from the deal with a total of 124,000+ (new plus existing) customers paying $50+ per month, which is 84% of DigitalOcean’s total revenue. ($6.2M/mo. * 12 = $74.4M/yr.)</li><li>Cloudways is projected to contribute between $13 and $15 million of revenue to DigitalOcean’s bottom line in the remaining months of FY2022 after the deal closes in September.</li><li>The acquisition of Cloudways will expand DigitalOcean’s global employee base by 30%. A good deal of those jobs are in Pakistan, and the sale represents the &#8220;Pakistan tech sector\'s largest exit to date,” according to <strong>Jawwad Farid</strong>.

I\'m also pleased I upgraded then, because after they reverted to the  original price structure I realized I\'m getting every feature of the old and new Business plan at about half the current price, although the storage is much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve dug in a little more since then, and this is clearly the best WP.com so far. Apart from some P2 demo sites, I\'ve never had much going on there. I have a second work account for &#8220;self-hosted&#8221; sites that use Jetpack, and it\'s still annoying to switch between them and manage subscriptions to comments and posts. You can only be longed into one .com identity at a time, and there\'s no way to sharing access with team members or clients except as admins of individual sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most surprising thing to see develop over the last six months or so is access to premium plugins — including Elementor and the Classic Editor, which are among the 36 &#8220;top premium plugins&#8221; listed. If you dig into the functional categories of plugins you can install, there are thousands. (I\'d love to know how these are being selected, or if all plugins in the .org repo are automatically included.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t explored how I\'d go about adding &#8220;third party code&#8221; or installing any of the 50,000+ plugins in the .org repo, but that\'s allowed on my &#8220;Pro&#8221; plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see it would be relatively easy to set up a Substack-like site at WP.com because I know the plugins you\'d need, but for the average user they\'d really have to dig into some docs and do the work of educating themselves.

She notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The open-source community is aware of its security problem. In fact, the community is already attempting to build out institutions and standards to secure open source. For example, the Open Source Security Foundation, or <a href=\"https://openssf.org/\">OpenSSF</a>, has already met with the White House twice and has 10 dedicated workstreams all focused on securing the open-source ecosystem. Companies like Microsoft and Google, large open-source contributors, have pledged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/white-house-open-source-security/\">$30 million</a> to support OpenSSF’s efforts. The <a href=\"https://ostif.org/\">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> (OSTIF) was founded recently to provide free security auditing services to open-source projects and continues to grow.<br /><br /><em>However, on its own, the open-source community does not have the leverage to demand the resources and minimum security practices required. To preserve its core ethos as a free service and commodity, the open-source community cannot impose conditional requirements on its projects. As a collaborative of many volunteer developers, it also struggles to impose requirements on its own contributors.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if that is really true and open source self-regulation is truly impossible.

This includes smaller related items like the shim for non-supporting browsers and adding PDF  support, which are being handled in separate tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads has been controversial from the beginning. While the Google-sponsored contributors driving the project have made some revisions after an initial round of significant critical feedback, other contributors have continued to voice concerns that they said were not being considered. Several contributors reported issues with the feature and suggested that it should start by being opt-in, an idea that was summarily dismissed before the main work was committed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz weighed in on the ticket with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:112\">new objections</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/MatthiasReinholz\">@MatthiasReinholz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eatingrules\">@eatingrules</a>, and others I think this approach is perhaps lacking. Why would there be twice as many image files taking up a lot of extra space when half of them will never ever be used anywhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IMHO a better approach would be to just make all image sub-sizes WEBP. If JPEGs are indeed needed, these can be generated on-the-fly as needed. There is no point of clogging the web servers storage with all these useless files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the WEBP file sizes are actually larger than the JPEGs, that would probably mean that better tools are needed, and this patch is premature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Six weeks ago, in response to one complaint that the &#8220;resources for conversion would be tremendous,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein confirmed that resources for generating the images on upload would &#8220;increase dramatically.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However resources to serve an image will be lowered,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Since image uploading is very rare compared to image serving, the extra effort to compress and store images should be worth it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another problem Ozz cited in his objection to this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Actually that dramatic increase of resources usage when uploading an image is a very bad side effect here,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;It means a lot of uploads will fail, and leave the users stranded. It also will increase support requests for both WordPress and the hosting companies dramatically. Don&#8217;t think this is acceptable. Because of this, even if image multi-mime support is needed in WordPress, the current approach doesn&#8217;t seem like a good solution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 24 hours later, Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:114\">commented</a> to advise that the WebP fallback mechanism to JPEG for older browsers was ready for commit and that he planned to commit it in a few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Please do not commit any more code here unless it is to address the dramatic increase of resources needed to create image sub-sizes after upload,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;As I said above such increase is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Is there any data about how much more resources (memory, processing time, etc.) are needed when uploading different image sizes? Any estimate about how many sites may be affected by that? Any suggestions on how to deal with it? Do you know what happens when post-processing of an uploaded image fails?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Frankly for now it seems that this patch will have to be reverted and refactored in order to address this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Silverstein responded to his concerns with clarification on why they chose the current approach, in anticipation of certain edge cases and eventually adding support for formats like AVIF once it is more widely supported:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I tend to agree with your assessment that all sub-sizes should be generated as WebP only, that was the shape of the original proposal. For the vast majority of use cases/users this will work the best. I would be open to considering this for the default (with some mitigations, see below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we decided to generate both formats was for backwards compatibility considerations for the few edge cases we identified where WebP images will might not work: namely emailed images (some older outlook/windows clients), Open Graph tags (some services don&#8217;t support WebP) and older Safari browsers. One possibility we considered would be to keep only the full sized JPEG so it is always available for those edge cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;multi-mime&#8221; support here is built to generating multiple formats so you sites can provide a primary and fallback format with something like the <code>picture</code> element. This is less important for WebP since it is so widely supported, but would be helpful for adopting newer formats like AVIF by plugins or core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein also said the option of generating images on the fly was something they need to figure out but &#8220;felt out of scope for this effort.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the complaint regarding the dramatic increase in resources for image uploads, Silverstein said they are relying on the &#8220;retry&#8221; mechanism to mitigate this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This change also doubles the number of times WordPress will retry&#8217; the image regeneration, so while processing time will increase, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see a jump in failures necessarily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know we had trouble adding new sizes in the past, however that was before we added the retry mechanism.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the WebP by default project is more focused on serving smaller image sizes on the frontend and considers the additional resource usage on upload a necessary sacrifice for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The additional resources at upload time needs to be weighed against the reduced resources of serving the smaller WebP image, especially since serving typically occurs several orders of magnitude more frequently than uploading,&#8221; Silverstein said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If uploading fails after all the retries, the user has the same experience as currently: they are left with a broken, unusable image. That can probably be fixed, although I don&#8217;t think this change will increases failure rates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:123\">commented</a> on the ticket to report issues with WebP conversions in the WordPress Photo Directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Just noting here, that these additional webp conversions appear to have been the leading cause of upload failures on the WordPress Photo Directory in recent weeks. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org//intertrac/ticket%3A6142\">#meta6142</a>&nbsp;and tickets closed as duplicate of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The errors were generally along the lines of&nbsp;<code>Allowed memory size of 256M bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 90M bytes</code>&nbsp;(obviously with byte values) while attempting to perform the initial full-size-original jpeg -&gt; webp conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn&#8217;t affected&nbsp;<em>every upload</em>, only that of certain images. Potentially related to the&nbsp;<code>$quality</code>&nbsp;value being passed for webp requests (IIRC the default of 82 was optimized for jpeg?).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12023\">disabled the JPEG to WebP conversion</a> as a result of these errors, as the photo directory doesn&#8217;t currently use WebP but noted that it &#8220;might be a sign that it might be worth considering only generating webp&#8217;s for the resized images, rather than for the original file too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein said they are investigating the issues Hulse reported, as it may have exposed a bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz circled back to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:126\">recommend</a> that making sub-sizes on demand would be a better approach that has faster processing of uploaded images and reduced space requirements, since the additional JPEG images would not be generated unless needed. He also noted that the &#8220;retry&#8221; for image post-processing &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work as well as expected.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The bad news is that if the post processing fails, chances are the originally uploaded file will remain,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;Then it will be used everywhere as most of the code in WP falls back to available sizes, and the only size will be the original. That means we will be serving huge (4MB &#8211; 8MB average) images.

How are you doing Andrew?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Andrew Palmer: I&#8217;m very good. Nathan. Thanks very much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] Nathan Wrigley: We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena and let&#8217;s be honest, it was a challenge finding this room, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] Andrew Palmer: It was, and especially as I was running late and you&#8217;ve been very kind to still accommodate me, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] Nathan Wrigley: You are, most welcome. Andrew&#8217;s been in the WordPress community for years and years and years, but it&#8217;s not been always on the up and up has it? You&#8217;ve had your moments where you&#8217;ve stepped away for a little while and now you&#8217;ve reemerged. Is that true? Is that fair to say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] Andrew Palmer: Kind of, I mean, I sold Elegant Marketplace to the wonderful people that InMotion Hosting. So that enabled me to go off and play golf for a little while, and invest in other businesses and interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think this is for you, you know, a moment of excitement or are you still with tentative steps?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] Andrew Palmer: It could be construed as a resurgence. I mean, I&#8217;ve always connected with the WordPress community, cuz we&#8217;re such a friendly bunch. I had an opportunity to develop plugins and be a product maker, and I took over a lot of products from a very good friend of mine and hopefully we&#8217;ve enhanced them and made them better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;ve listed a, a few of the things that you&#8217;ve been involved in, but you&#8217;ve obviously been involved in lots of different businesses. Do you think with 50,000 plus plugins in the WordPress repository, countless commercial plugins, are we in a saturated marketplace? What I mean by that is if you are creating a new product, is it very difficult to be discovered? Is discoverability really difficult? Okay, let&#8217;s take two scenarios. The first one you&#8217;ve got a budget to advertise. And the second one is if you have to bootstrap it and do more or less all of it yourself. So two parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:36] Andrew Palmer: You know, if you&#8217;re gonna do jerk sauce it&#8217;s still hard. You know, you&#8217;ve got supermarkets, they do their own brand as well. As soon as a brand new hot sauce comes out, the supermarkets go, oh, we&#8217;ve got our own version of this, and they charge you a few hundred thousand pounds to be put on the supermarket shelves. So, there&#8217;s always a price to pay isn&#8217;t it, it&#8217;s a pay to play arena in every single business aspect. So the benefit that we have in WordPress is that we can throw something onto WordPress dot org, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, throw is maybe not the right word because it does go through a, a little bit of moderation, one would hope, but, um, you know, you can throw out a free version of what you&#8217;ve got and test the market. That&#8217;s really cool because, you throw out an MVP and people then like it and you then put some pro versions together or pro bits and pieces and say, okay, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m willing to pay 10 30, 50, a hundred bucks for that a month or a year or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the competitive landscape of every business in the world is competitive by nature, because there are so many products out there that are similar. There&#8217;s loads of light bulbs out there. It&#8217;s not just Phillips. Loads of CDs, you know, it&#8217;s just not Phillips. So you gotta make your own way, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] Nathan Wrigley: With the whole plugin thing and the whole of saturation thing, you&#8217;ve launched several products over the course of your career. Most recently, maybe there&#8217;s something after this, but I think the most recent one is Bertha.ai. That&#8217;s actually the URL as well as the name of the product I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] Andrew Palmer: It is Bertha.ai. It&#8217;s uh, my very good friend and, uh, co-founder Vito Peleg phoned me far too early in the morning, because he gets up at five o&#8217;clock and said, hey, I got an idea, man, let&#8217;s do it. We did and financial situations, I&#8217;m the, you know, I&#8217;m the guy that&#8217;s got the cash and we invested in it and Vito invested, blood, sweat and tears as we all did. And I&#8217;ve got a development team, you know, and they worked really, really hard and we launched it at the end of September, 2021. It&#8217;s going well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] Nathan Wrigley: Is that the primary reason that you are here at WordCamp EU? Actually just rewind that a little bit. When the tickets were announced, I think you were the first person that I know who committed to coming. You probably weren&#8217;t the first person that bought a ticket, but in my social network, you were the first person who said, oh, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve bought a plane ticket. I&#8217;ve got the hotel and blah, blah, blah. You must be fairly committed to these kind of events. And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the thing? What&#8217;s the angle. Is it the community? Is it a bit of community, a bit of networking, a bit of marketing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] Andrew Palmer: It&#8217;s a lot about the community because, uh, I&#8217;m looking for developers, you know, so I need to chat to people and meet with people. And we are very lucky yesterday and got treated to a gin fest, by Codeable. Marcel who actually works in, for Codeable rather, in Portugal, did an event for Codeable and invited us all along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s all about networking, and we met a few, I met a few coders and had a good old chat, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s me networking. Supporting the community, as much as I possibly can, being a bootstrap business. It&#8217;s quite expensive developing a plugin and there&#8217;s lots of things you have to commit to like getting a new CMO, you know, in Stephanie Hudson. She&#8217;s got her own business to run and, and we&#8217;re all kind of bootstrap minded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we all have to do little things and Vito&#8217;s got Atarim to do so he&#8217;s gonna concentrate more on that now. So, you know, I needed a sidekick. Stephanie&#8217;s that sidekick, who&#8217;s got the strategy and the marketing nouse and she&#8217;s also based in the U.S. Which is good. And Bertha is now incorporated in the U.S. as well. So it&#8217;s all. Moving along swiftly, but I did actually release a GDPR plugin last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So GDPR friendly fonts, but it&#8217;s a commercial one. There&#8217;s a few free ones out there, but ours is good. So, launching things all the time and improving the plugins and making sure that we are in touch with what people in the community actually want, because we are here. Plugins, I think are more here to support the developer than the, than the end client. To give them an easier way to market if you like, or an easier or quicker, faster speedier way to get their product out, whether it&#8217;s, uh, an MVP for themselves or whether it&#8217;s a website for a direct client .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins and extensions and themes. And you know, what Gutenberg Hub doing with Gutenberg? What Extendify are doing with Gutenberg is quite amazing and all the form plugins out there, you know, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got very good friend Mark Westguard who&#8217;s does WS Form. It happens to be my favorite form. We happen to get on, which is really cool. So it&#8217;s about meeting these people. Coming together in Europe, biggest WordCamp in the world. You know, pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have a battle plan though? Do you have, before you set off. I was wondering, because you said earlier you wanted to meet developers and today was contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] Andrew Palmer: I couldn&#8217;t get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:23] Nathan Wrigley: Was it just because you were a bit late?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Andrew Palmer: No, I was a contributor, I was just late. I just kind of thought, well, do you know what? And Stephanie runs the Focus WP Facebook group. So we had a little meet up and we&#8217;ve gone out on the town and just met with a few people from the Focus Facebook group as well. So there&#8217;s always networking opportunities. There&#8217;s nothing else to do a WordCamp than have a great look at Porto, which is probably one of the best venues you could choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food&#8217;s cheap, and good. The weather has turned out to be better than we thought it would be. There&#8217;s a little spits and spots of rain, but effectively Porto&#8217;s a great historical town as So, you know, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a bit of a vacation stroke job bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] Nathan Wrigley: You said that you were in search of developers and the bit was gonna develop there was, so there was 500 odd today and it felt busy. Tomorrow, maybe more like, touching 3000. So it&#8217;s gonna be really busy. And if you haven&#8217;t got a, I don&#8217;t know, an agenda and a meeting list, do you literally just try to work out who in the room is a developer by just going up and talking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] Andrew Palmer: Well, I&#8217;m gonna be standing on a booth as well for an hour or so. And I&#8217;m also going to, I&#8217;ve got a few meetings scheduled, which is pretty cool. With developers as well as, you know, funders and people like that who are interested in either investing in Bertha or doing some partnerships with Bertha and stuff like that. Because once you&#8217;ve got a plugin that kind of answers all the questions with copywriting within WordPress, people want to talk to you, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a long day, Nathan, you know, it&#8217;s a very long day and it goes into the evening. I&#8217;m gonna have opportunities to meet and chat with people all the time. I&#8217;ve got tons of Twitter messages to answer, and stuff like that. You know what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:02] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m struggling keep up with the different platforms. This person is over here on Slack, this person is over here on Twitter. Yeah it can be difficult. So let&#8217;s talk about your, well, I&#8217;m guessing the booth tomorrow is Bertha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] Andrew Palmer: No, the booth I&#8217;m gonna be helping out Atarim, because Vito&#8217;s a very good friend of mine and I know Atarim pretty well. I&#8217;ve used it from the very, very beginning, and now it&#8217;s on version three. It&#8217;s their third birthday. And Vito likes to run around. You can&#8217;t really keep him to a spot. There&#8217;s a bit of super glue we&#8217;ve snuck in there. But Alex Panagis, he&#8217;s gonna be on the booth as well, and I&#8217;ll be hanging around and just answering some questions that people don&#8217;t really get it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, it&#8217;s so dual role. But of course Bertha&#8217;s gonna be mentioned in the conversations. Well, because that was actually the idea, is that Vito wanted an AI to be able to write within the note making facility, you know, you put these little notes on websites. So our first job was to make Bertha work in the front end of Atarim. And it does. So you can now, so customers can now say, right, I want this headline and then ask Bertha to generate an option for headlines and they&#8217;ll put it in. I want this paragraph here and all that kind of stuff, and Bertha can do that within Atarim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. I feel at this point, we should explain because we&#8217;ve stepped ahead. So okay, Bertha is a plugin for WordPress, which enables you to create AI content. So that could be any form of content. It&#8217;s just text, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] Andrew Palmer: Yeah, I think the best way to describe Bertha is that she is an AI copywriting assistant. So you are the editor, she&#8217;s the journalist that&#8217;s gone out and found the stories and the facts and the general content, and you working as the editor within WordPress, then edit that content and make it your own. And that&#8217;s the best way to describe Bertha. She&#8217;s not just a machine that says, right, write me a blog about this. We&#8217;ve got three things coming next week for the pro version. And one of them is very, very long form where you just give her a hint and she will write it for you. And then you just edit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] Nathan Wrigley: All right, let&#8217;s build up the jigsaw of how it all works. So we install the plugin, all of that normal stuff. How do we seed Bertha with the idea? So for example, let&#8217;s say that we want to write a blog post about WordCamp Europe. How do we seed the idea into Bertha, and how much do we need to seed in, in order to get something decent back? Let&#8217;s go with a title first, just the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] Andrew Palmer: Okay. Title you just say, what do I want to write about? So you just write, what do I wanna write about, I wanna write about blog posts being written by AI. And then say generate a headline around that. And Bertha will give you four alternatives, or two alternatives or three, depending on how good your one was, and you click and that&#8217;s, that then goes into the text bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you say, right, okay, I&#8217;m writing a blog post about this. So I&#8217;m gonna go to the blog post topic ideas model, and I&#8217;m going to give it the title and then, or going to give Bertha the title and then you press generate text and Bertha will come up with one to four or one to five blog post topic ideas. And then you put number one in as the title in a paragraph generator, and that will generate your paragraphs around that first topic idea. And then you just go through. It&#8217;s of a workflow that you get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:07] Nathan Wrigley: People listening to this, they&#8217;re gonna think, okay, this is voodoo. How does this work? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] Andrew Palmer: Well we&#8217;re very open about how it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s it is open AI dot com, and we&#8217;ve written our own models. And we now use the latest version of GPT-3, which is really fast and uses things called suffixes and prefixes. And it writes much, much better quality AI generated content. And it has the previous GPT, DaVinci was up to, I think, uh, 1999 or whatever it was. It was ages ago. It scraped 10% of the web to get the ideas for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is now 2021. June 2021. So much more recent content. If you wanna write about crypto, if you wanna write about FinTech or modern FinTech or anything that&#8217;s going on in the modern world. COVID for instance, you wanna write about that or the history of COVID from 1990, whenever it was. I can&#8217;t remember the dates COVID&#8217;s done my head in. It will write that history for you now. So it&#8217;s much better, much quicker, faster, better quality and, easier use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:16] Nathan Wrigley: People who&#8217;ve never used these tools before, they might have sort of concerns about a, does it scan, does it even read like a human wrote it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] Andrew Palmer: Oh, for sure it does, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you can be pretty confident that it&#8217;s gonna scan well. But in terms of the quality, where do you stand on how much supervision. Is it like an aberrant child? Do you need to go back to it and give it some love and attention? Or is this a case of, I am just gonna press the button, not read, publish. There&#8217;s probably a bit of a spectrum, but how much of you come to trust it to be left to its own devices? Or how much do you go back through and read everything that it generated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:52] Andrew Palmer: Well, when you are writing, you&#8217;re thinking about what you&#8217;re writing and Bertha does exactly the same thing. Doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s gonna write a paragraph ahead. Just like I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna say 10 seconds ahead. But I&#8217;m forming the words in my head and then they come outta my mouth and whatever. And I will make a few missteps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know politicians make missteps all the time, cause they, maybe they don&#8217;t engage brain before whatever, but, you have to be the editor. What I don&#8217;t want Bertha to be is a total AI copywriting situation. Just write everything for you, because that&#8217;s not fair on you as a producer of content, it&#8217;s not fair on your readers and it will eventually work against you because your content will become repetitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will become not unique. You won&#8217;t have your tone of voice necessarily. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s up to you, which AI generator you want to use. If you&#8217;re gonna be a spammer, then use the others. If you&#8217;re gonna, gonna really invest in your copy, but with the help of an AI, Bertha&#8217;s the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] Nathan Wrigley: So would it be fair to categorize if you&#8217;re gonna do longish form, it&#8217;s a launchpad. You click the button and there&#8217;s an idea here&#8217;s where you could go. Not necessarily, there&#8217;s the finished product. It&#8217;s a bit like a junior journalist would hand to an editor and say, I think that this is the finished product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Andrew Palmer: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Nathan Wrigley: Is that where we&#8217;re at? You should generate this content, then look at it yourself on every occasion because the AI, right where we are now is not quite to be trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Andrew Palmer: Well, yeah, just exactly like Tesla. They do an auto drive. It&#8217;s definitely not to be trusted. I was in one a few weeks ago on my travels in the States and all of a sudden we turned left into a bunch of roadworks, well what&#8217;s that about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, the driver was supervising quite well, but you know, you can&#8217;t trust AI completely. And I don&#8217;t think you ever should. There should always be some human interaction. That&#8217;s what I believe in that. My aim is with website production is to make it quicker, better, faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Yeah. And it helps with those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] Andrew Palmer: Yeah. I mean you&#8217;re gonna save between 80 and 90% of your time that you would normally write a thousand word blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I guess one of the concerns from people who maybe want to rail against this a little bit would be that that kind of control, that self control to go and read it, may not be forthcoming. In other words, we may have an internet where there&#8217;s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, possibly of blogs out there that are just pumping out content, click the button, publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:27] Andrew Palmer: Yeah but we&#8217;ve, let&#8217;s not be naive about this. We&#8217;ve always had that. There&#8217;s always been spinners of text and you know, the affiliate marketing world and the health and fitness world for years, you know, even before WordPress dare I say, you know, there was always people spinning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why things like Copyscape exist. Try and make sure that nobody&#8217;s using your content. But Bertha&#8217;s not just for blog post writing. Bertha actually helps you with every single aspect of your website. And the whole reason that we&#8217;ve got it in WordPress is because you can go through each model or each template. And you can write your homepage. You can write your services page, you can write your about us page. You can enhance your product descriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many models now in templates in there now, and next week we&#8217;ll be launching social media templates as well. So you can write a Facebook ad or Twitter post or whatever, within Bertha. So, you know, there&#8217;s plenty to look at, and the fact it&#8217;s free is where I&#8217;m at. I think we&#8217;re helping the community get a grip with free AI. You get a thousand words a month for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:35] Nathan Wrigley: How does the UI actually work? So presumably we&#8217;re in Gutenberg or the old classic editor. How do we interact with it? So we click into the title, take us from there. Is it like Grammarly? Does something sort of hover over us, which says engage Bertha?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:48] Andrew Palmer: Pretty much. And it&#8217;s any page builder. It doesn&#8217;t need to be just classic editor or, it is literally any page builder. And the guys at visual builder, or Visual Composer rather. They helped us immensely with Visual Composer because they&#8217;ve rebuilt that from the ground up and helped us code Bertha so that she works perfectly with Visual Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a Divi guy. I needed it to work within Divi. That was quite challenging. We&#8217;ve managed to do that. And Elementor as well. So whatever you are in, whether you are in a text field in Gutenberg or a text field within any page builder that you choose to use, Bertha&#8217;s little icon is there, just winking at you saying, I&#8217;m here to help. You click on that and then a sidebar comes out and then you&#8217;ve got all the models and you&#8217;ve got the web or the blog, website, content, blog, AIDA, PAS, P A S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we&#8217;ve even got evil Bertha, she&#8217;s quite fun. Bit of a sarcastic bot there. That was one of my favorites that we put in there. Uh, and then you have, on a separate dashboard, you have long form as well. So that&#8217;s a separate thing where you can just write long form content. Format it for your blog, and that will save, save it within your own database. And the benefit of Bertha is one, it&#8217;s unlimited users, because anybody that can sign into your website can use Bertha. Two it&#8217;s really accessible for WordPress users. If you&#8217;re used to WordPress, you can use Bertha and you can start using Bertha effectively within 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nice thing is, is that every single template has either a 30 second or one minute instructional video embedded in the sidebar. So you just play the video. You go, okay, that&#8217;s how I do that. The long form one, because it&#8217;s long form and it&#8217;s slightly more complex, you need to use a bit more logic with it, the instructional video is 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:30] Nathan Wrigley: The different language models that you&#8217;ve got, you mentioned the evil one and, you know, we could have the pirate one for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] Andrew Palmer: There is, we can do that tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. But there could be the sales for example, or I don&#8217;t know, whatever it may be. They genuinely spit out different content? And is that composed with a different choice of verbs or a different choice of vocabulary. And if you go for the humorous one it&#8217;s gonna throw out some curve balls and some interesting fruity language?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] Andrew Palmer: Frank Sinatra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Andrew Palmer: Hey blue eyes, how you doing? We wanted it to be fun, right? So you&#8217;ve got the tone of voice. So you have your title. Who&#8217;s it aimed at? Is it business users, people that buy flowers, people that buy motorbikes, people that love WP Tavern? What&#8217;s the tone? Is it fun? Is it innovative? Is it classy? Is it hilarious? Is it Frank Sinatra? You know, you can put in those. Is it Rocky Balboa? You know, whatever you wanna put in there as the tone of voice. And, uh, Bertha will speak in that tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:25] Nathan Wrigley: Presumably GPT-3 means that there was a two and there will be a 4. Do you have any insight into that? Is that the kind of thing which rolls out on an annual basis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] Andrew Palmer: GPT-3 has actually been improved. You&#8217;re on now DaVinci two. We use the highest engine, which is DaVinci ,and we use DaVinci two and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s another thing called babble and other things within it. You can kind of downgrade it. So for evil Bertha we use, um, I think it&#8217;s babble because it kind of just, it&#8217;s more sarcastic. It kind of gives better results. So we test all the models within the playground of Open AI and then we go, okay, well that&#8217;s how we can write that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we write the, we write the prompts and that&#8217;s the benefit of us being web developers. You know, Vito&#8217;s done thousand websites, I&#8217;ve done hundreds and maybe a couple of thousand three, three or 4,000 actually, if I look back on it, cuz I&#8217;m old these days and I&#8217;ve been building websites pre WebPress, right. Macromedia jobs and, even Front Page, but there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know what people want in a website. The content, the kind of flow, the blurbs, even the content. We&#8217;ve actually got a model for the contact form blurb. How to ask people to contact you. Because we know websites. We&#8217;ve built it specifically for website owners and website developers and producers, because getting content out of a client, that&#8217;s why Atarim exists. Getting content out of a client is like getting blood out of a stone. if you give them a method to do it or a way to do it, you&#8217;ll get it much quicker. You&#8217;ll complete your projects quicker. You will then be able to take on more projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s an interesting piece, isn&#8217;t it? The idea that you can, well previously you&#8217;d fill it up with lorem. If the client didn&#8217;t deliver the text, in goes lorem just to fill the space. To give it some indication of how it might look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] Andrew Palmer: That&#8217;s why Bertha is called the Lorem Ipsum killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] Nathan Wrigley: There you go, so that&#8217;s a really bonafide use of it, isn&#8217;t You basically push the button, fill it up with actual content. And even if the client doesn&#8217;t want to use it, then of course, I guess they could go in and edit it, or just start again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Andrew Palmer: Exactly. Yeah. You can actually deliver a completed website to a client with text. In the right format, in the right places, everything. And it won&#8217;t add a great deal of time to your development process. It will save a massive amount of time on deliverables. The client will see it. They&#8217;ll get it. And they&#8217;ll go, well, actually, I don&#8217;t wanna use that word or I don&#8217;t, I think that&#8217;s outta context, let&#8217;s rewrite it to that, and you can even use Bertha to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] Nathan Wrigley: So can you, as a website builder who maybe only wants certain permissions to go out to your clients, you can enable them to use Bertha or not use Bertha? There&#8217;s different permissions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] Andrew Palmer: Yeah there is within the settings page. We&#8217;ve done a, a nice little dashboard, nice little onboarding as well, you know, makes it easier for people to understand what it is. And there&#8217;s an intro video on the onboarding as well, which will probably update because couple of things have slightly changed, but because we&#8217;ve embedded the instruction videos within Bertha, it makes it much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re launching a deep dive academy in a few weeks time, and it is a few weeks time, because we&#8217;re just building out the long form videos. So educational videos of how to write a blog post, how to build a website from scratch using Bertha. How to use particular page builders and stuff. And that&#8217;s being done by Imran Sadiq who has been a godsend on the training. I mean he produced 54 training videos in just under 21 days. So he was a find, I&#8217;ve gotta tell you. He&#8217;s my, he&#8217;s my favorite person currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:50] Nathan Wrigley: When you push the button, and it spits out content. Presumably there&#8217;s a cost to that. In other words, it goes to a computer somewhere else. Maybe that&#8217;s your computer. Maybe it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s infrastructure. I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a cost for that transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;s gonna be constraints on the free version. Maybe that&#8217;s the number of times you can click the button, the amount of text you can produce, because I know that there&#8217;s a premium version as well. Just talk us around the pricing and the constraints that you&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:15] Andrew Palmer: Well, I made a decision because I, you know, I&#8217;ve invested in Bertha both time and money. I want people to use her. So a thousand words a month will cost me money, but that&#8217;s part of the investment, right? So currently, and I have no real reason to change this, everybody can use Bertha for free with every single model in it, except the new ones that I&#8217;ve said, because they are expensive to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So somebody&#8217;s gonna have to pay for those, and also pro users only get to use the academy as well. It&#8217;s free to pro users. So there are some constraints on the free use. But I, I love the fact that people are signing up. We&#8217;re getting probably 15 to 20 users signing up free per day, and they&#8217;re using it. Because we have a monitor. We, we don&#8217;t monitor what they use. We keep a record of what&#8217;s generated, but not by whom. You know, we don&#8217;t know which websites have generated, but that also helps us improve the model as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also if it gives empty responses, which sometimes it does. But we can see we&#8217;ve got a little, when a new user starts, we can see that there&#8217;s zero. And then within 10 minutes of them starting, they&#8217;ve used 250 words. We&#8217;re thinking, yay. You know, they&#8217;re getting it. They&#8217;re really looking at it. And then they go to 1,012 words because we&#8217;ve done it just over the thousand, because there&#8217;s nothing more frustrating when you click that button, you run out of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, we let them, if it&#8217;s got to 998 and then they want to generate more, we let them generate the next sentence and they go, sorry, you gotta wait another month or upgrade. You know, of course I&#8217;m a very commercial person and people who know me know that I&#8217;m commercial, but you know, wait another month. But with a thousand words, you could write a homepage. You could write good about us page, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] Nathan Wrigley: The thought occurs to me that AI is getting its claw into almost everything. You&#8217;ve got Alexa in the living room and you&#8217;ve got the possibility to create pieces of artwork with all sorts of AI content. And I&#8217;m just wondering given your position, you&#8217;re obviously thinking a lot about AI. What do you make of the future of website building? So not the, not the content. Not that piece. The bit about the layout, the feel, the color palette, use of fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I just find it almost inevitable that at some point we&#8217;re gonna be talking to the website building process, and we&#8217;re gonna be saying, I want a homepage with a picture of a stadium in the background with these words, and then you&#8217;ll see what it puts out and actually no change the font. Make it H2 instead of an H1 and so on. Do you think that&#8217;s closer than I&#8217;m imagining? Cause I&#8217;m still thinking that&#8217;s decades off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] Andrew Palmer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely not decades off. It&#8217;s 24 months off. You know, if you really, really get into it because, um, Google are working on image generation. But let&#8217;s also not forget that AI can examine an image and see what&#8217;s in it. So, the stock Adobes, the Shutterstocks of this world will think, well, hang on a second, we can tie up with an AI and ask it to recognize this gray head fella in a rowing boat, doing some fishing, whatever, no offense Nathan, and then produce that image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it would be, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to be an AI generated image because there are millions of, of images out there. And imagine if you&#8217;ve got the WordPress repository with that&#8217;s now, and I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of where the images are on WordPress, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:34] Nathan Wrigley: Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] Andrew Palmer: So Openverse is an AI feeder of images. You know, I want a nice lakeside image with no people in it, because that&#8217;s part of the Openverse terms and conditions. There&#8217;s no people in it, but I want a nice lakeside view, in landscape and I want the sun to be shining. And the AI will go out and search that, find that, and place it within your Gutenberg block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s interesting because I wonder, I wonder if people, so the particular next thing I&#8217;m gonna say relates to Bertha.ai. So I wonder if it&#8217;s got content creators, people whose job is to create copy. She&#8217;s got them shaking in their boots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I wonder if this event that we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe, 2022. I wonder if in two or three years time given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, maybe coming down the pipe, if it will be a totally different experience. The whole build process will be different and we&#8217;ll be concerning ourselves with all sorts of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the block editor might be a very, very different thing. And page builders look different. With the rate of change, and the fact that AI can sort of seed itself and make itself cleverer, much, much more quickly than we can, I do wonder what it&#8217;s gonna be like in a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] Andrew Palmer: There are some very clever people out there as well. You know, let&#8217;s not name drop too many people. Elementor for instance, who&#8217;ve got their cloud version now. In there, there&#8217;s a, a workflow and say, what type of websites you want? What do you want it to look like? What&#8217;s the colorways and boom, there it is. Extendify doing the same. You&#8217;ve got all the content blocks. What do you want in there? And you take you through a workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress will do that with their new $5 a month package, you know, and hosting and they&#8217;ll, they will build your website on the fly and, and, BoldGrid, I think it&#8217;s BoldGrid by, InMotion. It&#8217;s like a page builder that people don&#8217;t actually know about, but when I got into conversations with InMotion about them buying Elegant Marketplace, and I was basically a Divi marketplace, I&#8217;m saying, why don&#8217;t we make stuff BoldGrid, because you can go in there and say, I want a florist website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press a button, you&#8217;ve got 10 pages of flourish websites with all the images and the text. All you do is go in and edit the text. So that&#8217;s not AI, that&#8217;s just intelligent people saying, this is how we want people to build websites. So, with the advantages of AI and people like Matthew Renze, who I met in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. He&#8217;s at the top level of AI, and some conversations that I have with him, what&#8217;s coming, man is gonna blow your head off. It&#8217;s crazy what&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:57] Nathan Wrigley: On that bombshell. Andrew Palmer. Thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] Andrew Palmer: You&#8217;re more than welcome Nathan.

Theme authors have frequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes\">asked if there is a good starter theme for building block themes</a>, but at the moment there are really only a handful, as the block themes era is just dawning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebREDONE, a Serbia-based web agency, has open sourced its new starter theme, <a href=\"https://webredone.com/blog/wordpress-theme-starter-theme-redone/\">Theme Redone</a>, that offers a foundation for building websites and Gutenberg blocks with an MVC framework:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We’ve taken the inspiration from Laravel and other similar projects that really approached this aspect of coding cleverly and made it a breeze to organize and reason about the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Laravel, we would write plain old PHP for the logic, and then we would use Blade templates for the View layer, we also have model, view, and controller files to separate the concerns and organize code logically and efficiently. We have adopted that same approach but in the context of the WordPress environment. Conceptually, the way we organize code is similar to Laravel, but with a few differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme Redone brings this approach to Gutenberg block files, identifying a &nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/model-json/\">model.json</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/controller-php/\">controller.php</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/view-latte/\">view.latte</a> file.

Select extensions can be loaded up on a private test site for 30 days before the site self-destructs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WooCommerce.com already offers a 30 day money back guarantee if users are unhappy with a purchase, the sandbox testing offers a frontline prevention for customers having to invoke the money back guarantee. It saves both parties time and resources by allowing customers to test extensions against their unique inventory of needs without committing to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flow for this feature is strategic in that it requires prospective customers to log in or create an account in order to test an extension. This enables users to come back and revisit their test sites later during the decision-making process. WooCommerce.com can also collect data on how many sandboxes are started for each of its extensions and determine which ones are struggling to convert. I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up streamlining these sandboxes for better conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In my test of this feature I chose the WooCommerce Pre-Orders extension. Once logged in, the site loaded up in seconds with the extension already activated on an empty store. I was successfully able to create a product as being available for pre-order.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The live testing feature is not yet available for all extensions. WooCommerce engineer Rémi Corson reports that it&#8217;s currently active on the following products (with more on come in the future): follow-up emails, product add-ons, product CSV import suite, product vendors, table rate shipping, bookings, checkout field editor, points and rewards, and  pre-orders. Any of the available extensions can be simultaneously activated on an existing test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com&#8217;s sandbox sites are set up strictly for testing extensions in a simple way. This may not be the best if you need to rule out conflicts with other extensions during your tests. The test sites do not allow you to install a different theme or add any other plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the live testing feature should be adequate to answer most questions users have prior to purchasing an extension. It&#8217;s also great for demonstrating to a client in case of the necessity to justify the expense. Some of these extensions are in the range of $100-$249/year billed annually, which is not a trivial expense for people who are just getting started with a store and wondering if the extension will suit their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com is one of many digital product creators in the WordPress space that already employs this type of testing, though the life of the sandbox varies from an hour to several weeks. Offering instant live testing is definitely the way to go if you don&#8217;t want to offer a free version of your extension where users would pay to upgrade. It saves users the hassle of having to set up their own test sites and get a refund, but also allows them to truly browse a host of commercial add-ons that they may not have otherwise thought to explore.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:37:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.1 to Add a Block Themes Filter to Menu on the Theme Install Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137238\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-1-to-add-a-block-themes-filter-to-menu-on-the-theme-install-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1575:\"<p>In July, WordPress&#8217; Themes and Meta teams collaborated to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">add a new “Block Themes” menu item</a> to the filter menu on the directory homepage in an effort to improve block themes&#8217; visibility. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block themes</a> currently account for less than 2% of the directory&#8217;s 9,900 themes but activating one is the only way users can take advantage of WordPress&#8217; full-site editing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all users hunt for their next theme directly on WordPress.org.

The Gutenberg plugin is in active development and new features are created all the time. These new features come also with new APIs that are declared &#8216;experimental&#8217; until the team is sure that it&#8217;s a prudent implementation for this part of block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a major WordPress release is worked on, Gutenberg plugin code is merged with WordPress Core, and when these experimental APIs make it into the stable version of WordPress, they also earn consideration for backwards compatibility and de-facto code that needs to be maintained for a  few versions before they can be deprecated again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Zielinski suggests that before a feature makes it into Core that experiemental APis are audited and either are not merged into WordPress or worked on to migrate them as stable APIs. If a feature depending on  an experiemental API is not yet stable enough, and other features also depend on the API, both should not be deemed mergable to the next major WordPress version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other developers caution, that it might slow down the pace when new block editor features come to WordPress. For the impatient that might be of concern, I also have the feeling that it&#8217;s not a bad thing, when Gutenberg latests features stay in the oven to bake a little longer before they are merged and used by millions of people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding </strong>also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-proposal-calls-for-contributors-to-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core\"><strong>New Proposal Calls for Contributors to Stop Merging Experimental APIs from Gutenberg to WordPress Core</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>🎙️ </strong> New episode: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-71-fluid-typography-block-api/\">Gutenberg Changelog #71 – Gutenberg 13.8, Fluid Typography, updates to the  Block API and more</a> &#8211; with co-hosts Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Birgit Pauli-Haack </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-g\">Gutenberg Plugin Releases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote about Gutenberg 13.8 on the WP Tavern. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\"><strong>Gutenberg 13.8 Introduces Fluid Typography Support and Revamped Quote Block</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gutenberg 13.8, the first implementation of fluid typography is available. <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> posted a Call for <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/08/15/testing-and-feedback-for-the-fluid-typography-feature/\">Testing and Feedback for the Fluid Typography Feature</a> </strong>asking theme developer to stress test the feature with classic, hybrid and block themes and various other scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime Gutenberg 13.9 was released. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/oandregal\">André Maneiro</a></strong> was the release lead and published the posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 13.9?

Still, it\'s been an occasion to learn and think more deeply about the culture and history of WordPress, how things work or don\'t work.

Clarifying language and coming to some consensus about the terms and definitions that help people understand the project is really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-718bb272-a14c-4904-ab72-ded6fd3e100e\">However, a lot of valid points about those terms and the details of the 5ftF program got deep into the weeds or focused on things that simply are what they are and aren\'t going to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(That\'s the stuff that gets labelled &#8220;drama&#8221; and falls on deaf ears or gets batted around unhelpfully by people who should have better things to do.  Everyone has heard it a million times. Don\'t worry, I\'m not going to touch any of it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-5c310172-f0f5-4a15-89fb-9d9383586416\">We can only move forward, but are we living in the past?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-6c135ce9-57d9-48af-8a0d-e0bd756ba174\">As an open source project, the only question that really matters is, &#8220;What will drive WordPress forward?&#8221; Not in an ideal or theoretical world but with the army we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-563ef72a-ad24-4271-bdaa-2d540b279c33\">Or, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/08/01/open-source-and-the-free-rider-problem/\">as Josepha Haden-Chomphosy put it</a>: &#8220;How can we rebalance the tenacious need for contribution with the immense benefit WordPress brings to everyone&#8221; in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-cb7c0968-427e-4652-8704-a63477ffcd44\">That question got lost in the reactions, but it\'s the one that matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-907aaa2f-8d3f-45af-9c7a-9bfe571224f6\">Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read that &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s. You can read it as a description of scarcity all on one side and abundance all on the other. You could tear it up and set it on fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people do do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The world as it is</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">Especially in the world of WordPress extenders, builders, and generally small business operators doing well enough to start a podcast or opinion blog, this seems to be where we get stuck. (That\'s the big, long tail of the open source communities I\'ve been in for two decades.) I\'ve watched this all happen before around an open source CMS that once dominated the market. Imbalances, inequities, and unfairness got emphasized, and the community didn\'t get past its deadlock of grievances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">I\'m not going to say there aren\'t imbalances and all the playing fields are perfectly level because that\'s not true. (It never is, anywhere.) But I will say it doesn\'t do any good to keep saying this. Repetition of failed patterns is not just a definition of derangement, it is a failure to grow into mature thinking. To really face the world as it is requires a capacity for living with apparently unsolvable contradictions. It is less about &#8220;being smart&#8221; and more about a tolerance for the mental stress and pain of not having control or all the answers. It\'s fucking hard, but not being able to do it does harm to individuals and the groups they\'re in. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task our oldest, most adapatable, legacy systems — human languages — were invented to do as we muddle along together on this planet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-505bdd5e-f2fe-4c3c-9673-566df571dcf1\">I\'m also not going to say we can make deep problems disappear by not talking about them or by using evasive language. I do think we can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task that human languages were invented for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-24ad1539-b961-418f-b0f9-9d1098a1392a\">There\'s nothing like an external threat to unite people, usually. Lately there\'s been a lot of concern about the end to growth and possible losses in WordPress\' market share. I\'d worry more about losing relevance with younger generations of people with different outlooks, interests, and needs. That\'s people doing stuff. It\'s real. Market share will always be a statistic that dimly reflects what people are doing long after they started doing it. Today\'s failure to connect and communicate won\'t register on <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms\">the BuiltWith pie chart</a> for years when it\'s too late to get in front of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creators in community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7dad336b-aaf2-4a48-a2c5-be3f8cb710ce\">So let\'s talk about the &#8220;Creator Economy.&#8221; It\'s not a trend but a pretty established thing now. Creators with a course, service, or product to sell generally don\'t want to focus too much on tools and even less on code — unless code is their service or product.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to people in their 20s today.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">WordPress and ever-increasing, low-cost, easy-to-use SaaS platforms have enabled Creators to focus on their business. Unlike those of us who were doing this back in the Stone Age, Creators don\'t have to install WordPress, try to bolt on installs of phpBB, GNU Mailman, and learn PHP4 to cope with a once-popular horror like osCommerce. Creators are in, or adjacent to the WordPress community, but they\'re unlikely to participate in it and contribute in the old, traditional ways that start with bugs and hacking. Software that\'s free as in beer and speech isn\'t attractive or even meaningful unless it\'s presented as a useful platform for their particular niche. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">This is painful to hear, especially if this is how you entered the open source and WordPress community. Many of us became developers, designers, freelancers, communication and marketing consultants, and even product or agency founders this way. That was a different time in a different country — once the main doorway into WordPress, it\'s now a small, creaky backdoor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f154735a-096a-4c53-a676-455606234ca8\">If you think this means Creators are narcissists and mercenaries who don\'t participate in communities or care about their tools, you are wrong. Helping them organize into communities that give them value is a smart move. WordPress products, especially ecosystem plugins, virtually grow their own communities. With a now-private Facebook page that\'s grown to over 133,000 members, <a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor is the biggest example of this</a>, and they are pivoting to redefine themselves accordingly. Their identity doesn\'t emphasize a WordPress plugin but a platform (and community) for Creators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f02749a6-c26d-4c1c-a349-444397d597d0\">That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to most people in their teens and twenties today. And if they look a little way into the very limited &#8220;WordPress news&#8221; space, Creators aren\'t going to see Creators there. Certainly not a wide range of artists and makers. They may see &#8220;drama&#8221; and arguments, or &#8220;inside-baseball&#8221; like this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-b4807b88-ab9a-4ce7-9086-3d43929ede71\">Craft + Commerce and WordCamp US</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-60bdea77-3b00-4542-8adb-25b820780a7d\">I found Joe Casabona\'s &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpreview.io/a-tale-of-two-keynotes/\">Tale of Two Keynotes</a>&#8221; really helpful for understanding some key threats and opportunities WordPress needs to face in the context of today\'s Creator Economy. Joe\'s main point is that Creators focus on earning and growth in their businesses in a context where this message is encouraged and prioritized — and WordPress needs more of that. I\'m not opposed to that view, but it\'s not the main thing I got out of Joe\'s post and want to elaborate here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-3af73ea5-8fda-4846-8a60-557c2b9dc5ee\">Joe looks at the language ConvertKit founder Nathan Barry used to invite community participation in his last keynote for Craft + Commerce, a major conference aimed at Creators in his hometown of Boise, Idaho. Then he looks at the language of participation in Matt Mullenweg\'s speech in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-no-4-state-of-the-word-2021-analysis/\">the last State of the Word</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-fff2770d-4439-4673-9878-843a5481044a\">Barry emphasized goals that could be summed up as, &#8220;You can and should make a good living doing what you love in the creator economy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Here are the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-team-responses-to-the-state-of-the-word-2021/\">Post Status team responses to SotW 2021</a>. Rereading my own remarks, I\'m reminded of how optimistic that moment was — about all the same themes I\'m touching here.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-98dc48a3-e947-4e5f-8260-33984b488b5d\">Matt emphasized learning through contribution and the danger of more being taken out than given back. What stands out most in my memory is his &#8220;Give a penny, take a penny&#8221; analogy for open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-18f2b1bb-119f-47db-b4cf-0ec4cb188eec\">(That\'s not a knock on Matt, pennies, his analogy, or least of all the idea that you learn by doing — with others who know more. Post Status is all about that. We repeat &#8220;learn by helping&#8221; all the time. An example of this actually went out in our latest newsletter. But I do think &#8220;learn how to earn together&#8221; is a unique emphasis of the Post Status community within WordPress, and it is closer to Barry\'s language than anything as close to the project as Post Status is.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2c2832da-0b83-467c-80a9-e5a11f17d025\">As he seemed to intend, Matt\'s keynote reminded me of the values of small towns at their best, where I\'ve lived about half my life. That part of me sees Barry as a bit of a huckster — sure, everyone\'s winner! What exactly is he giving you? Lifetime free access to ConvertKit? Or just high fives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">I don\'t see the two keynotes reflecting scarcity versus abundance thinking or even two very different attitudes, but if you wanted to polarize people over them you could. Pick on the vulnerabilities of one, and amplify the strengths of the other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are strengths and limitations to both emphases — Creating and Contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">What if we tried to combine the strengths of the language of contribution with new, complementary ideas and language from the Creator Economy?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-145fb39a-674f-43b8-8c1f-67c8f17881cb\">&#8220;Creators&#8221; vs. &#8220;Contributors&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9a877702-0b72-40e0-a837-7a43f5155548\">There are strengths and limitations attached to both of these words when they\'re used to define identity and participation in a creative community. <em>Creating</em> and <em>Contributing</em>. They don\'t seem very different until you take a close look.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">Contributing has distinct emphasis on giving, not getting back. It is a zero-sum transaction between a contributor and recipient of contributions. To use the language of contribution effectively, you probably have to be seen as truly having a greater need than the people you are asking to contribute more. Better yet, they should see themselves as implicitly benefiting from their contributions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">If they don\'t believe this is true, repeating the old magic words will not work unless you do it live on air, interrupting normal programming until enough contributions have come in. Until next time. (Kind of like Admin Notifications used for upselling premium plugins.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-991b730c-d674-41c3-abf1-e7068185e881\">Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what should we do differently?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">Am I proposing a massive Search and Replace targeting all forms of the word &#8220;Contribute&#8221; in WordPress? Nope. I personally find calling people &#8220;Creators&#8221; more cringey than the older, grammatically tortured term, &#8220;Creatives.&#8221; But I recognize when I am out of date, and I am willing to adapt where I see value in doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">I\'m not proposing anything but that we think more carefully about language, tone, and audience. What we emphasize with one word or story as opposed to another may close or open doors with different people. It\'s good to have a lot of options to engage a lot of people. It\'s good to be flexible and adaptable. It\'s good to know what connects and unites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-e55a849a-8cf5-48f7-b311-570266746adf\">Do we know?<br /><br />Can we create it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2d71356b-5b29-428e-a3e8-3618cb28851a\">Can we teach it to each other?</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 03:28:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Join the WordPress World Photography Day Challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137161\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/join-the-wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3044:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/chrisedwardsce/\">ChrisEdwardsCE</a>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of World Photography Day, WordPress&#8217; Photo Directory team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">issued a challenge</a> designed to get people contributing:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Submit a photo that captures something unique about your local area</strong>, in a way that helps represent the geographic diversity of the WordPress community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch, the WordPress Photo Directory has grown to 3,633 free, CC0-licensed photos. The purpose of this challenge is to raise awareness of the directory project and encourage people to contribute photos to expand the collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo contributors are encouraged to submit an original image of something from their local area (neighborhood, town, city, or country), such as a landscape, street, local wildlife, nature, or a landmark. In addition to following the directory guidelines, participants should also add the following information to denote their work as part of this initiative: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(1) The location or where the image was taken (e.g. the city and/or country)</li><li>(2) The word WorldPhotographyDay22</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo Directory team contributor Marco Almeida has an additional recommendation for well-known locations that have an English counterpart for the name in the original language:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Quick suggestion for submissions: if you’re uploading a photo that has regional interest and the name of the place is not the same in English and the local language, do repeat the photo description in both languages. For example: “<em>Walking on Lisbon’s sidewalk &#8211; A andar na calçada de Lisboa</em>”. This will ensure the photo is both searchable by “Lisbon” and “Lisboa”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Submitted photos that are approved may be featured across WordPress.org&#8217;s social media channels. Photo contributors will also get a contributor badge on their WordPress.org profiles, which I was surprised to find on mine after contributing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/26962070d8/\">a picture of my morning oatmeal</a> a few months ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Participants can submit up to five photos at a time but will have to wait until those pass through review before submitting more. If your photo is approved, the Photo Directory team requests you leave a comment on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">challenge post</a> with the link to the photo and the story behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specific instructions for submitting photos are available in the announcement. If you are a photography enthusiast, this challenge is a great opportunity to give back to the world of free WordPress resources. The challenge will conclude on August 28, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 01:24:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: YITH Wonder: A New Free WordPress Theme with Support for WooCommerce and Full-Site Editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/yith-wonder-a-new-free-wordpress-theme-with-support-for-woocommerce-and-full-site-editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3194:\"<p><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/\">YITH</a>, a WooCommerce plugin development company that was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newfold-digital-acquires-yith-to-expand-woocommerce-expertise\">acquired by Newfold Digital</a> in March 2022,  has released its first block theme on WordPress.org. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is now listed among 122 other <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block themes</a> that support full-site editing and have recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">gained their own menu link in the directory</a> to improve their visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder includes 24 different patterns &#8211; many of them aimed at shops. Since the company specializes in WooCommerce products, it&#8217;s no surprise that YITH Wonder offers corresponding styles for WooCommerce products, shop pages, cart, and checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes three full-page patterns for different homepage layouts and designs. These are very helpful for quickly putting together a page without having to hunt for and place each pattern in the right place. The full-page patterns can easily be previewed on the theme&#8217;s listing on WordPress.org: (<a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-1\">Homepage 1</a>, <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-2\">Homepage 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-3\">Homepage 3)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder comes with six different style variations that make it easy to change the the accent color combinations and typography for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://wonder.yithemes.com/ecommerce/\">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s website. One handy feature on the demo is that you can click &#8220;Launch Sandbox&#8221; to instantly spin up a test site with the theme and WooCommerce pre-loaded. The sandbox sites expire after one hour. This gives a user the opportunity to explore the full-site editing features and see if the theme will work for their particular use case. For example, users can see how the WooCommerce product catalog template will look with their own customizations applied. The theme packages two dozen different templates and template parts that can be customized inside the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder is listed as a multi-purpose WordPress theme in the directory but it really shines as one of the few free block-based themes built with WooCommerce in mind. Creating a new page and slapping one of the full-page patterns on it is a delightful experience that will save users time in getting started and also enable them to build targeted pages featuring different product categories or sale items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is available to download on WordPress.org for free. I couldn&#8217;t find any documentation for the theme, but it may be available once the company formally announces the theme on the YITH website.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 21:29:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 65) — How We Talk When We Talk About WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/how-we-talk-when-we-talk-about-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53009:\"<div class=\"wp-container-29 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">What\'s it like to enter the WordPress community media space, especially as the editor of a publication with many voices, personalities, and perspectives? </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">My friend and dialogue partner, <strong>Nyasha Green</strong>, is six months into her role as Editorial Director at <strong>MasterWP</strong>, so today we\'re talking about what that\'s been like for Ny, what she\'s learned, and how we look at the WordPress media space we both work in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly we talk about conflict, communication, personality, and the importance of in-person events.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Good. Pretty good for, uh, winding in towards the end of the week. I know. Um, let\'s see, your, your newsletter from master VP goes out Tuesday in our productions Friday. So maybe you can, it goes out Wednesday. Oh Wednesday now. Okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday, Tuesdays. You\'re getting it already. Yeah. Okay. So you\'re kind of, is this the down slope for you? easier time,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> eh, yeah, it is. It is. The beginning of the week is always like, alright, make sure everything\'s together. And then it\'s like, ah, you know, breathe and like can hop in and getting ready for next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it definitely is. And it\'s almost Friday. Yeah. All good news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, for us it\'s like, yeah, it\'s the, the high, when you get it all done on, on Friday and then the weekend. So, um, you\'ve been at it for about six months. I read your your six month. Article, uh, post [00:01:00] there and reflection on all the stuff you, you guys have done in that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. How are you, how are you feeling about, um, about not just doing master WP, but this is kind of a new thing for you jumping straight into the, um, the WordPress community as someone who\'s, um, you know, come, come in from, uh, not that, not that long ago for the first. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So, um, I\'ve had, I have a experience in WordPress, so I\'ve been coding in WordPress for a couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ve been writing and editing for what 16 years. Um, and just, yeah, putting it all together to be like a part of the community to be a part of the writing, to be a part of, you know, everything that\'s going on. Um, it has been. Fun. I don\'t wanna say that first. It\'s been very fun. Um, it\'s also been very entertaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s been [00:02:00] very interesting. Um, Hmm. It\'s been. Oh, oh, it\'s been just a journey. And, um, it\'s just been six months, but I\'ve learned a lot. I\'ve met a lot of really good people and I\'ve got to do, I\'ve gotten to do a lot of really cool things. Um, I\'m really excited for the rest of this, the next six months. I\'m just I\'m ready for that year article, like to just talk about everything we did in a year, um, But, um, I think the most interesting thing about it is, um, just, just getting to know so many people in the community, not just in the community, because like I was, I\'ve been in the community for years as a coder, but I haven\'t been like, you know, an active participant in like, as far as meeting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So meeting active people in the community has been really awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that\'s really different. Isn\'t it? I, I relate. It\'s a lot. I feel, um, I, I feel similarly because despite going back early long way with open source and, and WordPress [00:03:00] site, I probably got more involved long ago in other communities and I\'ve stayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stayed for a long time in a, you know, relatively quiet, neutral space relative to, to post status and, and, um, and just, um, my own work for a long time. But it\'s, yeah, it\'s relatively recently that my role has kind of expanded and changed and re not, I wouldn\'t say required, but made it natural to, um, and if not, Necessary to, uh, you know, be more engaged in social media and, um, and just, yeah, the kind of networking that, that comes around from that and the, the way that people, uh, connect with you more when you\'re, you\'re taking more of a public role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. There\'s ups and downs, ups and downs to that. How, how do you, what, what do you see the pros and cons [00:04:00] or what have been the highs and lows for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, the pros would be the people I\'ve met, um, as a relative newcomer to the community and someone that\'s trying to get more people in, um, being, you know, editorial director of master WP has opened me to so many resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many people that want to help in this community. And I feel like that does not, nobody really talks about that. That doesn\'t, uh, that never makes it out of the screams. Drama whatever\'s going on that week in WordPress, but there are so many people that want to help the community, especially newbies, but they don\'t know how, or they they\'re more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will, I have resources for you to help, which is still helping. And I was able to connect with a lot of people. Um, I have been given a lot of resources for just starting my own word, press meetups in my city. I was just living in and the city I\'m doing now. People just they\'ve read and they\'ve seen things I\'ve [00:05:00] doing they\'re let me start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve read things I\'ve written and they\'ve seen things I\'m doing and that spurred them to help. So it\'s been mostly positive. Um, for me. Great. Um, some of the cons is, um, something I, I\'m not new to leadership. I\'m not new to taking ownership of things. I\'ve had my own business before, things like that. Um, I guess the biggest thing for me is when master WP gets negative, press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s all people wanna talk about to me. Uh, if they talk about that, amongs the self that\'s, whatever that\'s it\'s okay. But when lots of really positive things happen, like I said, like me gaining these resources, us having, helping new people get into the community, people, uh, you know, changing their tune on things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just didn\'t have information about which we\'ve, we\'ve been told all of us that that\'s helped at least someone, no, it is nothing. Nobody really wants to talk about it. And it could be because negative stuff, you know, people aren\'t louder when they\'re negative. Versus they\'re a little bit more [00:06:00] quiet when they\'re positive, but that\'s something that it didn\'t bother me at first, but it was overwhelming after a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm. Because. I\'m a person, like if it\'s something\'s negative, that\'s going on, I would like to work with you on it. But I quickly discovered a lot of people don\'t want that. They just wanna be negative and, you know, yeah. So navigating that\'s been interesting. Um, and then we, we, we shifted a lot. Master WP is completely different than what it was under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the old ownership. And I think a lot of people had a problem with that as well. Um, especially when we talked about race and diversity and oh, my favorite giving people money. I understand that. Cuz I talk about that in regular life. I\'ve been a community organizer for years. I do community service. Um, and I don\'t, I don\'t have to answer to an organization to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do stuff out of my own pocket. That\'s how I am. So this stuff is not new to me. Um, but it\'s, it\'s interesting to see people [00:07:00] take on those. You shouldn\'t be helping people or you shouldn\'t be doing. In a space where they constantly is, need a need for help. So I\'ve, I\'ve learned a lot. It\'s it\'s it helps me ponder and wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I, I don\'t know. I\'m just, I\'m very interested to see what else I learned because six months, depending on who you talk to is not a long time. I don\'t feel like that was a long time, but I poof I\'ve learned a lot. So this year should be pretty epic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. You really jump right in and yeah, when you do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public like that. And you\'re, you\'re putting out the kind of material you do on, um, writing and, and podcasting mm-hmm um, yeah, you get, you get a lot, learn a lot from getting a lot of reactions fast and when you become the news it\'s, it\'s not, not awesome. I have a little experience with that. But yeah, no one can really control the message all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, [00:08:00] uh, being able to roll with that is, is good. But, um, yeah, I hope the, the positives outweigh the negatives. Where, where do you think the, um, some of the pushback or raised hackles? Come from, is it just, who are you to say, just where does this new, you know, just reaction of, of established or familiar, um, people who are familiar with the space and, and feel really, um, comfortable in it, the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I don\'t know who you are. You just come out of, you know, you\'re offering new perspectives and, you know, different, different takes on things or, um, is that. Is that just kind of the newcomer, um, challenge that I don\'t know, human social groups always seem to, to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> have. Oh, I would be surprised if that wasn\'t playing a part into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, because, um, some people I have talked [00:09:00] with interviewed, you know, written to they\'ve written to me, you know, they\'ve been in this community like. Years and years while I might have been still been in high school, things like that. So I definitely, I, I could see some of that. Definitely. Um, I guess the big thing is nobody really addresses a lot of negative issues with me, which, which I\'m totally prepared for as editorial director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it\'s, it\'s always secondhand stuff. And it\'s like, how do you address that? I\'m one of these people, like I said, I address things and that people take that in a negative way. I don\'t understand that. Like I. I have always been able to communicate with people. If there\'s a issue, I think we can solve it if we talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don\'t think a lot of people have that point of view. They don\'t want to talk, they don\'t wanna solve issues. They just want you to know they are not feeling it. And that\'s also fun. But, you know, as a person who\'s a doer, I can only accept so much of that, you know, send it to me, but what do you want me to do with it after a while it\'s gonna be my response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so it, [00:10:00] you know, there. I\'m a newbie, you know, we\'re new, I guess we\'re as a whole newish people on the scene. Um, although Rob and Brian and a lot of our, uh, developers have been in WordPress years. Mm-hmm um, there\'s also I don\'t know what I I\'ll call it. I always try to make up my own names for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s getting into the group. I guess liking what everyone else likes and hating what everyone else hates, which we, we won\'t do. And master WP is right. Individual people. We, we also, that\'s a big issue too. We get, if Rob has an issue on something, that means we all think it, if Brian has an issue on something that makes we all think it, if I have an issue with something that means we all think it and, um, that\'s not true at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We are very open and diverse about that, but that, that gets lost too. So I think it\'s. , you know, we\'re not as a whole waiting and liking the right things. I can tell you as a person, an individual that will never be me. I\'ve never been able to do that. [00:11:00] Friends, family work. Yeah. I\'ve never been able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it won\'t be me, but, um, I think that plays a part into it too. And then I just think, you know, We\'re saying things that some people have told me privately, they wanna say, but they can\'t. So it\'s a number of things which I am so interested and totally down to explore in the next six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s good curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>helps, especially with, with negatives. Um, yeah. Why in, instead of just hardening up or closing off or writing people off, um, there\'s always something to learn. You know, it occurred to me listening. what you\'re, um, saying there about a publication with a lot of voices. Mm-hmm um, it occurs to me that there isn\'t we, and we talk about this a lot, the WordPress news space or whatever you want to call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s pretty small. Mm-hmm and um, most of the people in it are, you know, we\'re pretty [00:12:00] small team at post status, but, um, there\'s, there\'s multiple voices and we, we aspire to. To have that, um, kind of sense of dialogue, but a lot of people are just doing, you know, it\'s one, one person, one personality. And so you, you get kind of used to their perspective on things mm-hmm , mm-hmm and maybe there\'s not as much of a familiarity with, um, in, in the space with, um, Hey, this is a publication where we actually want to have a lot of D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People and different diversity of views and they may not stack up or align and it\'s not planned. It\'s not to, to do so. It\'s not meant to, um, push a certain stance, but yeah, inevitably there are some kind of ranges of opinion that a, a publication will kind of get known, known for. Mm-hmm um, I wonder if that\'s just too new of a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don\'t [00:13:00] distinguish between, oh, who wrote this? Who wrote that? Um, yeah, I think that can, that can easily be part of it, but, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you know, I didn\'t, you pray up a good point. I didn\'t, I, I did not. And we have talked about this, but I never really, I didn\'t, I didn\'t think about that. You just like enlighten me at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, uh, a lot of publications where it\'s not as many people. Getting a platform to talk about this many different things. So that could be very confusing to readers and people consuming our media. And that\'s. Thank you. That\'s something we need to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Thank you. Yeah. And, and a lot of, a lot of those individual voices have kind of been typecast, maybe unfairly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think sometimes even individuals change their views, moderate them, come to new opinions and things. But over time people tend, oh, this podcast, he thinks this way, she, she looks that way. [00:14:00] Um, That might be some of it. And, and also everyone\'s just guilty going so fast, having so much going by how, how deeply do we read or listen to things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. And we just kinda box people up quickly. Yes. Um, I, I, I, I think we\'re in personality. We\'re probably a bit alike in that, you know, liking a certain amount of. Friction and difference to have some have things to talk about, um, to learn from something that\'s not familiar or someone who doesn\'t agree with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. Um, yeah. And you guys actually, you know, pay for advertise that you want, you disagree with this. You, we pay you just as much to write for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah. Come pay. We\'ll pay you $300 an article to come disagree with us and yeah. S I\'m hearing again, secondhand. So many people have these disagreements and I\'m like, why not get, get paid for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s my dream to go disagree with people and get paid for it. Like if [00:15:00] someone had given me this opportunity when I was younger, I probably would be a lawyer because I would be so good at arguing with people. but, uh, yeah, we do because we do, we want to. Opposing views. Like we don\'t all, and we all don\'t agree with each other, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I love BTS. Brian does it. Um, Rob has his views on multisite. I\'m indifferent to it. , you know, we, but we all get labeled, like, you know, oh, if that\'s Rob\'s idea, then it\'s our idea. And I, I don\'t completely blame the community for that because that\'s life. Right. You know, when you think about, well, it\'s you think about like companies, sometimes companies get, um, mislabeled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I, I like to use the New York times as an example. Like the New York times is pretty progressive. Most of the time left leaning, in my opinion, that\'s subjective. And they will run op-eds with conservative point of views and Republicans and things like that. And they get crucified and it\'s like, everybody forgets that , they\'re running different opinions all the [00:16:00] time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I think that\'s that\'s life sometimes too, so I don\'t take it personally. And, um, right. It\'s something we can always work on. I\'m always open to working on things. Yeah. And that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> what you get from a democratized publication space that no, one\'s able to squash out one particular voice and, and ideally it, they can be in some kind of productive dialogue with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think too listening to if, if you go, if your publication is, and, and a lot of, a lot of the. WordPress space is, is geared towards what\'s the drama of the day or what\'s, you know, what\'s the controversy up here. The, um, I wonder how much of it has to do with like energy levels, cause that stuff can raise energy and levels, expenditure and anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and it also, there\'s a cognitive load to who is this? Who wrote this? Do I know them? Who are, you know, there\'s all this, it, it takes real effort to. To make that three dimensional to [00:17:00] make that connect, um, more deeply. And, and I think that\'s just what happens on the, on the internet, unless you make the effort or, you know, you meet it at word camp or something, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t, you don\'t have context. And, um, I understand you don\'t want to deal with, um, a lot of noise some of the time. And, um, since I\'m not really running. Opinion or oriented, um, publication and actually going slow and focusing on more business pragmatics, a lot of the time and avoiding drama. That\'s, that\'s kind of what our longstanding, um, Attributes that people like that I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> thinks for the special sauce where\'s in that Dan where\'s oh, actually life is meant to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I [00:18:00] like to have fun. risk. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s in, it\'s in there. I think it, I think it just comes SL it comes slower and. When you\'re able to do more listening and, and cover a lot of things, not just like what is going on in the core project, but, or automatic, but there\'s a whole ecosystem. There\'s little fish and big fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s middle, middle sized ones. There\'s, there\'s all these different, um, concerns around the. The commons around, uh, WordPress that everyone has in common as they\'re what they\'re basing their business on in some way. So I don\'t know. I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t, I think that\'s fun too. It\'s a different kind though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, and it doesn\'t, uh, it\'s, it\'s definitely, um, definitely a different maintains, a different mood. Um, but. [00:19:00] Yeah. What do do you, do you think that there\'s a, there\'s a, a regular current, we need to maintain in this space where there\'s critical questioning, um, a kind of dialogue going on that, um, that hits maybe some of the bigger, um, Bigger tougher questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Nope. I think people should be able to say whatever they want, you know, um, as long as it\'s not hate speech and no one yells bomb in a crowded theater, that\'s my opinion on that. Um, no, one\'s even when. Profess your love of things. People are going to disagree. I think no matter what you write, people are going to dis disagree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, post status, you know, y\'all, y\'all have a pretty neutral stance on things and y\'all do a good job of it. And people still disagree with you. So, oh yeah. Um, no, I mean, you know, so it\'s like, there\'s no ways to avoid it. I don\'t think there\'s a plan for that, but, um, I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t [00:20:00] know the, I guess I\'m ponding that answer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I\'m thinking about, but until then, I\'m not going to, you know, limit anyone. I want them to speak about everything. If we could talk about everything everywhere all at once, I would love that, but being realistic, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I wasn\'t suggesting it\'d be a limit limited in some way, but that, um, just the, the, this, the public, the WordPress public sphere, I say sometimes, you know, kind of the, the debate, um, arena, the public square it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not always in the greatest shape, especially now you might, might, might exist. um, is there, is there work to be done there where there are unavoidable differences, disagreements, big thorny questions that do need to be maintain? Yeah. There [00:21:00] needs to be some dialogue maintained about those. And is that kind of more, what you\'re you\'re tackling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, honestly, no. Um, but because this is the thing and I, I\'m not just, just saying it for you. It\'s something I had to work with too. We\'re all. We\'re all from different places. We have different cultural backgrounds and we have different, even if we have the same cultural background, we have different upbringings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re different people. I don\'t think there\'s going to be a uniform way to do that with so many different personalities. I\'m not saying, you know, if it could be done. Sure. I just don\'t think it can be done. Um, we\'re also different. And I think honestly, if we embrace that more people wouldn\'t be, as you know, what\'s the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it wouldn\'t come off as, um, antagonistic. Is that a word? Did I make that up? Yeah. Yeah. I think people wouldn\'t be, be like that, but it\'s, it\'s like, okay, this person is this type of way. And we\'re just gonna write [00:22:00] them off as oh, that\'s them? No, let\'s, let\'s bring \'em in. Let\'s see why they\'re that way let\'s work together in this, this, this community, like a community should, um, if we\'re a community, a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They take, they take care of each other, they\'re they, you know, even their craziest member. Well, I gotta stop saying that. Um, even their members that we think are eccentric or we think are not like us, we take care of our, we take care of our own. And, um, I don\'t see that in the WordPress community. I see. Oh, that\'s just the way they are when that person could be one of the greatest people you\'ve ever made in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you gave it a chance, um, or they could be horrible, but you know, what are we gonna do? We\'re gonna try. We\'re gonna not try. We\'re gonna give. Are we a community or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that, that\'s kind of what I mean, like, do you see yourself as kind of in your mission to, to try to create an inclusive space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not one person or one, you know, organization or just one particular agenda and on any issue, [00:23:00] but, um, open kind of the open stage, um, ally, ally kind of brought that up. What was the mm-hmm the, um, podcast episode she did recently where. She talked, she called it debate club, which to me sounds a little little on the antagonistic side of, and she meant it more on, you know, like back in the olden days when maybe high, high school debate clubs were, were, uh, not, not as, uh, intense as I imagine they might be now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just a space where, where you can, um, you. You can try out different ideas and it\'s, you know, it\'s not to be taken personally like this is, we\'re gonna try to, what\'s the best case you can make for this. What\'s the best way to look at this issue. And, and then how does someone who totally takes it another way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do they respond to it? Is that the kind of, would that be like a healthy, healthy thing [00:24:00] that you guys are shooting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> we don\'t have a uniform goal. So that\'s, that\'s again, a thing like is master WP. Doesn\'t have a, a, a one thing we\'re all trying to do. Um, so I mean, if you\'re asking me personally, um, I, again, I don\'t think that\'s possible because the people are so different and, um, I wanna just spin that on. Like, I\'m not saying like, everybody is like so different from me and I just feel overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I meet a. Uh, kindred spirits in the community. Um, but it\'s just like, even when you just said like, you know, debate club was kind of harsh, that was like probably the most, I think, polite thing you can say. I can\'t think of anything polite or to say and that\'s not anything wrong with you. That\'s just something I have to look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, um, I try to, I\'m trying to make my language more accessible. Like not say things like crazy, like it tears me up to say that like, so, you know, that\'s something, um, I think, you know, I wanna work on, but also like I [00:25:00] don\'t, I don\'t know. That\'s something I\'ve never thought about. That\'s a that\'s Ally\'s idea and, you know, ally works with master WP, but we, we haven\'t talked about that as a whole, as master WP because master WP lets everybody express themselves and be their own person and have their own ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Not saying no one else does, but yeah. Um, I don\'t think it\'s possible me. Naisha saying that now the rest of my team may have different thoughts on that. And actually I think that\'s really awesome. And I want to talk to Allie about it. I wanna talk to my team about it. So, um, yeah, I\'ll definitely talk to them about it, but, um, I just don\'t see it as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also don\'t see it as necessary. Um, I don\'t, I don\'t, people are always going to yell and Twitter has given people the ability to yell from their homes. Like, you know, it\'s people who would yell at about stuff and complain and say things. They would never say if they had to say it in public, Twitter has given them that space and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\'t really take it away. Um, so I don\'t know Dan, to answer your question. I don\'t think it\'ll work, but I don\'t, I don\'t like saying nothing will work. I think everything should at least be [00:26:00] tried. Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, I think, yeah, the more good models there are, um, the better, yeah, like checking, checking ourselves on the, what seems like crazy far out irrational, extreme opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that\'s just, so that\'s such a common feature of when things get bad in a, in a community, um, inability to talk because. You\'re, you know, some other perspective is just so far, far out. And, uh, that, that may be the case. Maybe things are, you know, really that broken sometimes. But I would like to think, and I, I don\'t think they are in, um, something like in an open source community like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you just kind of have to give people that, that tolerance. Forbearance is a good word. Um, and step back from, you know, recognizing this, okay. I don\'t know where they\'re coming [00:27:00] from. This doesn\'t make sense. I\'m gonna try to find out, I\'m gonna try to understand it from their point of view rather than oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, call it just nuts. Um, yeah, I think that\'s hard to do when we don\'t, we don\'t have a space where that, um, seems to happen. A lot. And it reminds me, it actually reminds me of way back when I did a lot with Jula kind of when they\'re at their high point and then over it, um, it\'s a lot, it was a lot similar to WordPress in that, um, They developed a, a third party plugin theme ecosystem is where there are a lot of people making good money and agencies and so on, and who really feel in invested in, in the product and then very, sometimes alienated from where it\'s going and how decisions get made and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and. That kind of language emerged, like just complete your perspective is so far out from mine clearly. , [00:28:00] it\'s, it\'s, um, not worth any time to try to understand. And yeah. Do you see that kind of thing going on? Is that something we can help in, in some way, is that just helped by letting more people. Have the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> floor, more people need to be elevated in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Um, I get asked to do a lot of podcasts and things, you know, like what we\'re doing now. Sometimes I just say no, because I don\'t think I should be the only voice. I don\'t think I should be the only one talking for master WP. I don\'t think I should be the. No, nobody\'s like done this, but in, uh, outside of nobody\'s done this in the WordPress community, but outside of the WordPress community, I don\'t think I should be the black person you go to talk to about, about black issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, um, Once I, I, you know, I, I have my voice and if I wanna say something and if I wanna talk to people, I can do it. Um, but other than that, I think we should be elevating people. I think if the community was a little bit more diverse, I know I say that all the [00:29:00] time, people would know how to deal with opposing opinions, from different people who may be from different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see that I see it as diversity issue. I see some of the same people who click together, not agreeing with some of the other people who were the same and click together. And I\'m like, if you guys didn\'t do that, maybe you wouldn\'t be so upset all the time, but I don\'t know. What do I know? I\'m new. I\'m I\'m joking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, I guess would the, would there be a space where everybody could just be, not use bad language or threatening language and it\'d be like a little safer space for people. Again, culturally, I, I think that\'s impossible. Um, because you know, my, you could disagree with me as long as you don\'t cuss at me or yell at me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can disagree with me all day, but that\'s not with other people. It\'s like, you can\'t use certain word and completely understandable. You can\'t use certain words with me. You do that. That\'s that\'s, that\'s why I tap out. We have to learn that about each other. And if like, if [00:30:00] nobody\'s willing to learn that, and I mean, on both sides of people who don\'t want you to use any strong language, don\'t wanna learn that about other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, you know, strong language is not a big red flag to them. And I think people are misunderstanding each other. They\'re like, wow, he\'s, you know, they are just so threatening toward me. And they\'re like, I thought we were having a regular conversation or maybe on the other side of that, like, you know, I, I just it\'s people need to talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s communication problem. It\'s a diversity problem. It\'s communication problem. If we want those spaces to happen, people need to talk to each other. I don\'t see a lot of people talking to each other in the C. unless they agree with each other and that\'s bad in any community,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right? Yeah. The absence of, of any, any friction there, it\'s, it\'s a tough mm-hmm seeming paradox of the absence of, of conflict tends to indicate a problem because people are just individuals and, and different and you, and you need that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need questions and [00:31:00] friction to be. To come up with better ideas and to grow, to grow, to see things that you didn\'t wouldn\'t otherwise see. And, and if you\'re repressing all of that, it\'s gonna blow up some more dysfunctional way. Oh yeah. So yeah, the high conflict personality, I think in. Psychology is, is actually someone who, who just doesn\'t doesn\'t have any repertoire of responses to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a normal part of life and they try to avoid it and try to suppress it. And that actually causes more conflict than they just don\'t have the tools to, um, to deal with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Do you think, uh, maybe I, I have a question. I\'m sorry. You said high conflict people. Yeah. Right. Who, what would, uh, be your definition of high conflict people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I\'ll tell you mine, and then I can tell you, and then we can talk. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think, I think the psychological model, um, that I dimly have read about is, um, it, you, it is [00:32:00] just the simple definition would be someone who ends up in conflict a lot. Um, and maybe they don\'t know why , um, mm-hmm they may not think they are because they\'re trying to avoid it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm and. you know, like, um, say like the worst example would be like, you know, estrangement in a family or something like that. Mm-hmm so these two people don\'t talk mm-hmm at all. That\'s not a condition of detachment or peace. Uh it\'s a, it\'s a cold, it\'s a simmering thing that will go off as soon as they get together or something triggers it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mm-hmm um, Yeah, high conflict tends to come from not being able to manage reasonable levels of conflict in reasonable ways, because that\'s just what human groups require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t think like most of what you said is kind of subjective though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh, sure. , it\'s just a, a model, uh, a hypothesis, I guess,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but like, I, I think I could fit into [00:33:00] that because I, like I said, when I told tell people, like I address things, people can take that as like, if.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'ll like yell at you. If you say something to her, I can say, but it\'s not that I like to talk to people like positive, or it could be positive or negative. You could come to me and say, oh my God, ni I just had the great day ever. And I\'m gonna say what happened? Let\'s talk about it. You could come to me and say, I just had the worst day ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m like, dude, what happened? Let\'s talk about it. My responses will not change. Um, but just people who address things because we\'re in a community, we\'re in a society. , we\'re in a place where. People are very nonconfrontational. They are very nonconfrontational in the text space, not even just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So I, I could come off as like confrontational or aggressive and I\'m not I\'m I will, my responses will be the same. I just, yeah. I like, I\'m curious. I told you, I\'m a naturally curious person. I ask you like 50 million questions a day and you always answer, and I appreciate you. and I, I, that, but that could be taken the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s [00:34:00] like, I\'m not a psychiatry person or psych psychological person. I can\'t look into all these things to see how we should treat these different people. And that, I just think we should have more opposing or diverse thoughts so we can, you know, get more people who are not just like in a echo chamber together, and then we can grow and make changes from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just, there\'s no way we\'re gonna get to a point where everybody\'s nice to each other because nice is subjective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Well, yeah, and there\'s a lot of culture in it too. I, I think what in the way I I\'m looking at it, um, the way you describe yourself and, um, I would probably fit in that, in that too, is, is not a high conflict personality, but people might who, because, because you\'re a pressure valve because you\'re, you\'re, you\'re not gonna bury stuff or, and it\'s not that big of a deal to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But the per the person who\'s trying to avoid. Conflict that every turn is suppressing. What they really think is suppressing, [00:35:00] uh, things that probably matter a lot to them. And you don\'t even know. And then boom, it comes out at one point that\'s. Oh yeah. That\'s a really negative kind of conflict to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if, I don\'t know, you keep it kind of at a Luke warm level. A lot of the time, it\'s not, you know, that\'s pretty good. I\'m I\'m originally from the, the Northeast and. And there\'s , there\'s generally more time, especially in the Metro Northern New Jersey, New York, um, region there it\'s um, it\'s, uh, it\'s probably looked on as, as high conflict personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s aggressive. aggressive. Yeah. Drive. Sure. Learning to drive in, in New Jersey is fun. Um but it\'s actually, it gives you a lot of, it\'s a lot of tolerance. It\'s a lot of space because you can, people can push each other a long way and it\'s, and they have a lot of options to, um, , there\'s a lot of moves you can make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and a lot of it is. You know, [00:36:00] it\'s just, it\'s just talk it just Jerry Feld, people like to talk um, but then, you know, moving to the Midwest or the south at different times, totally different thing. And people don\'t interpret, um, you know, the threshold that they have for tolerating. Um, Um, open disagreement or questioning is lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. So low differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And , they love me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. I mean, I kind of missed the Southern ways of, of kind of. Backhanded dealing with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> things. I don\'t miss this. We see we, we are opposing each other again. I, I love that New Jersey, New York, Boston way of, of being of talking to people because it\'s, you know me to understand it\'s it\'s so it\'s genuine, like here, like people could be talking to you and hate your gut, so you\'d never know oh, bless your heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So awesome. Like, [00:37:00] oh God, I hate that. Those are fighting words. So again, like someone might say, bless your heart. Oh, they\'re they\'re blessing you. I\'m like, no, they wanna fight. I\'m just kidding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I got used to it. I don\'t know it, but it\'s, it\'s a way of everyone knows is they\'re putting it off to the side. I, I never really figured out the, the Midwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, doesn\'t really have anywhere for it to go and that, uh, that\'s a problem. I don\'t have a lot of west coast experience. I don\'t get it at all then. Oh, I love the west.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t like the west coast. We disagreeing again. Dan, we\'re supposed to be, I don\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I\'m just saying I\'m neutral. I mean, I hardly, I\'ve only been there a few times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m kind of probably biased against Southern California car, all that. I probably like the north in the bay area, but we\'re gonna, we\'ll actually meet each other. In San Diego so we can, yes, we can check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s gonna be fun now that you say that I love the voice closed. The people are so laid back in my opinion.[00:38:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re so laid back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that\'s the reputation. It just, yeah. Is there, is there something else going on underneath? I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That is so funny to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>huh? Insidious Californians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yeah, it\'s a big, well, that\'s, it\'s a huge, we generalize like that. So these it\'s like GDP of a top, one of the largest countries, big population, very first, every respect and yeah, WordPress is, it\'s like California. It\'s like, like any big country. It\'s just, I think the diversity is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, yeah, it\'s in, it\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> in. I\'m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> sorry. There\'s there\'s not, there\'s a lot of underrepresentation of mm-hmm underrepresented groups. We that\'s definitely there, but there\'s huge diversity in the types of personalities and people and what their [00:39:00] experiences are and how they came into WordPress and how their business works and what ships they\'ve got on their shoulder or what words will trigger them off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t know that, that stuff until you get up pretty, pretty close and. Yeah, I don\'t, I don\'t know if there\'s much we can do, um, podcasts or articles to, uh, smooth that process of, um, connection. I think that\'s more of an in person thing, your, your meetups that you\'re starting are probably most important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentoring, you know, gets people together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, if it\'s me mentoring and you. I have this stigma against me who people really be happy about that. not saying I do. I\'m just saying, um, just adding on what you said about diversity. Um, we need more diverse people too. I know we had diversity diverse minds, but if we were as diverse as Iowa am comfortable with every podcast I would get asked on, wouldn\'t be led by [00:40:00] white men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s been one, there\'s only been one I\'ve been. Or been asked to be beyond that wasn\'t led by white man, and it was led by alley my homie alley. So it\'s like, yeah, that\'s not diverse. That\'s that\'s not it at all. Um, diverse minds. Yeah. What do those mind, what are those minds attached to so I I\'ll, um, I think we need to go a little further with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, I think we need to go a little further with that, but, um, I lost my thought. I\'m sorry. We need to go further. We need to go further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. And well, yeah, I think you\'ve affected change in that area. Winston, I think was early voice there and Allie and love her and you and love her. Um, yeah, I mean all people I, I hope to meet, um, and getting, um, kind of beginning to normalize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you call it? Uh, travel [00:41:00] scholarships. Um, and yeah, you know, you wanna have underrepresented people here. Well, let\'s, let\'s meet the needs. Let\'s actually talk about that. I kind of like it\'s, it\'s too bad that, um, people are kind of desperate for getting tickets to word, word, camp us. Um, but I kind of like the fact that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are talking more openly about, um, about the process, you know, there\'s the whole what\'s, when are you going? What, what days? And all of this stuff, that\'s kind of all out, out in the open rather than just, um, I don\'t remember seeing that quite so much. It</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> used to be as like a secret, what was it? Tell me about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I don\'t know. No, no, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Maybe I just wasn\'t paying attention. It was not a secret, but, um, I think, I think that. That it\'s been a couple of things that it it\'s been so long since the last one, that this is kind of a [00:42:00] reboot plus everything else that\'s going on in the community. And then 600 5650 tickets, um, that went on the market and got snapped up in 45 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s, it\'s definitely, there\'s definitely more talk about. About the journey there and the importance and the importance of it. Um, and I don\'t know, that just seems good. Um, in some ways I, I wish, um, you know, I hope everyone can, well, I wish everyone could make it. Who wants to, I wasn\'t, I wasn\'t sure if I would, um, initially, but, um, Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people are saying, Hey, I need . Is there a way I can get, um, then, then that\'s in the, in the community there it\'s in like an a, it\'s a basic question of, um, can I get there? Can I be in, I wanna [00:43:00] be included in this, is that possible? Um, I just haven\'t seen that, that come up before. It\'s just a very private thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, I think that\'s. Well</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s upside. I mean, it\'s not awesome that people, people are gonna get shot out. I or it\'s to something. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, of course not. It\'s awesome. That. The want is that high, like, oh yeah. Especially to network and meet everybody in the community. Cuz I mean meeting face to face, I think, eh, it is COVID, I\'m kind of hesitant on that and what monkey pop now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh. Oh yeah. But um, I think meeting will actually help people too. I think the internet gives you a lot. Gives not you. A lot of people louder, negative voices than they. Would usually have, yeah. I think a lot of, um, impersonal contact will, that\'ll be one thing that helps. So that that\'s an answer to your question earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s gonna help. We\'re gonna have such a good time at work camp and like, everybody\'s gonna be like happy and they\'re gonna love each other and your face. [00:44:00] I, I just wanna see your face, but I think you be like, Hmm, we\'re gonna, what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it\'s gonna be good. You\'re reminding me of my. Friend and cop neighbor when I lived in, in Milwaukee and he, uh, what, nothing go ahead, get a certain personality type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and he was actually very sensitive and, uh, well, red guy, but, uh, if I mentioned. Anything that sounded like that. He\'d say something about like, uh, yeah. And all the animals and people will hold hands and dance around the trees together or something like that was</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> his. And why can\'t we do that? It\'s California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s Southern California. We can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it\'s always, it\'s always worth the effort of getting, getting people together and it does happen. It\'s a very individual thing and I, I hope there is. More of that. I\'ve only gotten it online when, when I take the time to, [00:45:00] you know, take some blows and talk to people, um, listen, don\'t react and, and try to understand where they\'re coming from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s just, yeah, it\'s, it\'s so much easier in person usually because, um, yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> just empathy. Oh yeah. We need a lot more. You do you want me to end by like singing some Julie Andrews? I have a really great voice. Oh, wow. I\'m joking. I\'m joking, Dan. No, you look too excited. Never mind you look so excited by me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> there\'s a, there\'s a karaoke request from Miriam Schwab. Um, in our, in post dad, slack. Yeah. People are lining up. And then out burger trips</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> and I do love karaoke. Okay. We\'ll we\'ll do it in California. We\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you are, you are a singer. Is that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> true? I am not. I lied. No. Okay. I, I have like a people tell me I have a singing voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know what that [00:46:00] means. I guess I kind of, I, I like, sometimes my sentences are like long, like a song, like I\'ll extend out a word that I, I don\'t know, but I cannot sing. I will sing though, especially at karaoke. So you\'ll see. All</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. I will definitely be watching. avoiding .

Tính không đồng bộ của nó loại trừ việc đợi phản hồi từ server - bạn có thể chuyển sang lệnh tiếp theo. Tuy nhiên, khái niệm về vòng lặp sự kiện mà nó sử dụng có thể trở nên khá rắc rối. Khi mọi sự kiện mới được gửi đến cuối hàng đợi, quá trình xử lý trở nên chậm hơn. Điều đó giải thích tại sao NodeJS sẽ không thực sự là ứng dụng phù hợp nhất cho các hoạt động chuyên sâu của bộ xử lý.

Do đó, các nhà phát triển nhận thấy Go rất dễ sử dụng vì ngôn ngữ này có syntax gọn gàng và rõ ràng. Điều này làm cho nó đơn giản hơn các ngôn ngữ khác.</li><li>Vì Go đang trở nên phổ biến, nên sẽ có nhiều nhà phát triển học nó hơn. Điều này sẽ giúp việc thuê các nhà phát triển Go trở nên dễ dàng hơn trong tương lai.</li><li>Bạn sẽ thấy dễ dàng hơn để duy trì các ứng dụng được viết bằng Go vì mã được viết bằng Go rất dễ đọc.</li><li>Go có nhiều điểm tương đồng với C. Vì nhiều lập trình viên biết C, C # hoặc C ++, họ sẽ thấy dễ dàng học Go. Ngay cả với những người mới bắt đầu cũng không quá khó khăn để nắm bắt được ngôn ngữ này bởi vì Go rất đơn giản và trực quan.</li><li>Go cung cấp một thư viện tiêu chuẩn tinh vi, hơn nữa, thư viện này rất dễ sử dụng. Lập trình viên không cần phải nhập các thư viện phức tạp bên ngoài hoặc phải tìm hiểu thêm các kiểu thư viện như vậy. Thư viện chuẩn Go hỗ trợ nhiều chức năng. Bạn có thể sử dụng chúng để hoàn thành nhiều nhiệm vụ và không cần phải viết những đoạn mã phức tạp.</li><li>Go giúp các nhà phát triển viết mã không có lỗi. Vì đó là ngôn ngữ&nbsp;<strong>statically-typed</strong>, bạn sẽ không mắc phải những lỗi phức tạp liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>. Go có tính năng thu gom garbage hiệu quả và hỗ trợ quản lý bộ nhớ an toàn. Tất cả những yếu tố này làm giảm khả năng xuất hiện lỗi.</li><li>Go giúp viết các ứng dụng an toàn và lợi thế này liên quan nhiều đến cách giúp viết mã không có lỗi. Trong thế giới ngày nay, tội phạm mạng không ngừng tìm kiếm những kẽ hở để khám phá trong các ứng dụng phần mềm. Một ngôn ngữ lập trình làm giảm khả năng xảy ra lỗi sẽ mang lại những lợi thế nhất định.</li><li>Google tích cực hỗ trợ sự phát triển của Go và các công ty thúc đẩy nó. Gã khổng lồ công nghệ sử dụng Go rất nhiều trong các dự án của mình. Bạn có thể chắc chắn rằng Golang sẽ nhận được sự hỗ trợ phát triển mà nó cần.</li><li>Các lập trình viên có thể tận dụng các tài liệu tuyệt vời có sẵn cho Go. Khi bạn viết một chương trình trong Go và bạn quên tạo đủ tài liệu, ngôn ngữ sẽ cảnh báo bạn.</li><li>Go không cần&nbsp;<strong>interpreter</strong>&nbsp;vì nó là một ngôn ngữ&nbsp;<strong>compiled</strong>. Điều này giúp nó mang lại hiệu năng cao.</li><li>Go hỗ trợ&nbsp;<strong>concurrency</strong>, giúp lập trình viên xây dựng hệ thống với mức độ xử lý song song cao.</li><li>Go giúp các lập trình viên xây dựng các ứng dụng có khả năng mở rộng. Ngôn ngữ lập trình này giúp các nhà phát triển nhanh chóng xác định các&nbsp;<strong>bottleneck</strong>&nbsp;có thể ảnh hưởng xấu đến khả năng mở rộng của ứng dụng. Điều này cung cấp cho họ đủ thời gian để tối ưu hóa ứng dụng.</li><li>Các nhà phát triển Go có thể dễ dàng thực hiện phân tích static code bằng&nbsp;<strong>GoMetaLinter</strong>, đây là một công cụ khá hữu ích.</li><li>Go cung cấp một API giúp các nhà phát triển kiểm tra code của họ. Các lập trình viên có thể sử dụng nó để bắt đầu hoặc bỏ qua một bài kiểm tra, cách khác, họ có thể sử dụng nó để chạy các bài kiểm tra song song.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"52-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m-c%E1%BB%A7a-golang\">5.2 Nhược điểm của Golang:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Các nhà phát triển cần code nhiều hơn để triển khai các chức năng phức tạp trong Go so với một số ngôn ngữ hàng đầu khác.

Việc tìm kiếm nhà phát triển</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vì NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript và nhiều nhà phát triển đã biết về nó, bạn có thể tìm nhà phát triển khá dễ dàng. Bạn sẽ cần nhiều thời gian và nỗ lực hơn để tìm các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Learning curve</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>&nbsp;của NodeJS ít khó khăn hơn vì JavaScript đã được phổ biến rộng rãi.&nbsp;<strong>Learning curve</strong>&nbsp;của Golang thì khó khăn hơn nhiều. Trong so sánh NodeJS và Golang, NodeJS là một lựa chọn tốt hơn xét về Learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. Sự hoàn thiện</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go trải qua những phát triển và cải tiến, tuy nhiên, chúng tuân theo một mô hình có hệ thống. Mặt khác, một số API NodeJS trải qua những thay đổi thường xuyên. Điều này cho thấy sự thiếu hoàn thiện của NodeJS. Golang đã đạt được mức độ hoàn thiện hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Hiệu năng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Như đã được đề cập ở trên, khi nói về hiệu năng thì phải nhắc đến Golang. Cho nên ở khía cạnh này mang lại hiệu năng cao hơn NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>5. Khả năng mở rộng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trong khi cả NodeJS và Golang đều giúp bạn tạo các ứng dụng có khả năng mở rộng, thì Golang hỗ trợ&nbsp;<strong>concurrency</strong>&nbsp;tốt hơn. Điều này làm cho nó trở thành một lựa chọn tốt hơn để viết mã các ứng dụng có thể mở rộng.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>6. Tính sẵn có của các công cụ và framework</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cộng đồng các nhà phát triển NodeJS đã tạo ra một loạt các công cụ và framework mã nguồn mở. Yếu tố này giúp người lập trình đạt năng suất cao hơn. Để so sánh, bạn sẽ tìm thấy ít công cụ và framework hơn cho Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>7. Tránh lỗi mã hóa</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go là một ngôn ngữ&nbsp;<strong>statically-typed</strong>, giúp loại bỏ phạm vi các lỗi liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>. NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript là&nbsp;<strong>dynamically-typed</strong>. Bạn có thể tìm thấy các lỗi liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>&nbsp;khó gỡ lỗi hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>8. Xử lý lỗi</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Golang yêu cầu xử lý lỗi rõ ràng. Điều này đòi hỏi một cách tiếp cận có kỷ luật và có hệ thống để mã hóa, giúp cải thiện khả năng bảo trì. Về khía cạnh này, Golang thích hơn NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>9. Triển khai</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Việc triển khai các ứng dụng được viết bằng Go dễ dàng hơn so với các ứng dụng được viết bằng NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>10. Hỗ trợ cộng đồng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cộng đồng các nhà phát triển NodeJS rộng hơn và sôi động hơn cộng đồng các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>11. Maps trong Go và NodeJS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Map</strong>&nbsp;trong Go là&nbsp;<strong>hashmap</strong>, rất giống với map được sử dụng trong Python hay NodeJS. Là một cấu trúc dữ liệu, một map trong Golang là một tập hợp không có thứ tự của cặp key-value với mỗi giá trị duy nhất cho mỗi cặp. Nó khá là hữu ích cho việc lưu trữ thông tin và tìm kiếm. Cơ chế lưu trữ tương tự với NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>12. Machine learning với Golang và NodeJS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Với Golang,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>&nbsp;đáng được xem xét. Đó là một thư viện mã nguồn mở cho phép tính toán số. Tuy nhiên, API được cung cấp cho Go sẽ không cho phép các model training. Mà người dùng Go chỉ có thể sử dụng các model đã được train. Cho nên để xác định và đào tạo các model, hầu hết các dev của Go phải sử dụng Python, tải chúng lên Go sau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Còn với NodeJS, bạn có thể tạo các model và train chúng ngay từ đầu nhưng cũng có thể sử dụng lại các model đã được train. Trong trường hợp đó,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>&nbsp;cũng sẽ là một sự lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Vì NodeJS cung cấp nguồn thư viện tốt hơn nên trong khía cạnh&nbsp;<strong>Machine learning</strong>&nbsp;NodeJS có lợi thế hơn Golang. Tuy vậy, cả JavaScript và Go đều không phải là lựa chọn đầu tiên với machine learning. Có rất nhiều thư viện được tạo sẵn cho Python và các ngôn ngữ khác, trong khi Go và JS yêu cầu nhiều công việc hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>13. Benchmark</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rất khó để đưa ra thời gian chính xác về việc chuyển đổi context liên quan đến các&nbsp;<strong>various model</strong>&nbsp;này. Vì vậy, thay vào đó, bài viết sẽ cung cấp cho bạn một số điểm&nbsp;<strong>benchmark</strong>&nbsp;cơ bản so sánh hiệu năng server HTTP tổng thể của các môi trường server này. Hãy nhớ rằng rất nhiều yếu tố liên quan đến hiệu năng của toàn bộ đường dẫn phản hồi HTTP end-to-end và những con số được trình bày ở đây chỉ là một số mẫu tập hợp lại để đưa ra so sánh cơ bản.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đối với mỗi môi trường, tôi đã viết mã thích hợp để đọc trong tệp 64k với các byte ngẫu nhiên, chạy hàm SHA-256 hash trên đó N số lần (N được chỉ định trong chuỗi truy vấn của URL, ví dụ: .../test.php?n=100 và in kết quả hash trong hex. Tôi chọn điều này vì đây là một cách rất đơn giản để chạy các điểm benchmark giống nhau với một số I / O nhất quán và một cách có kiểm soát để tăng mức sử dụng CPU.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đầu tiên, chúng ta hãy xem xét một số ví dụ về concurrency thấp. Chạy 2000 lần lặp với 300 yêu cầu đồng thời và chỉ một hàm hash cho mỗi yêu cầu (N = 1) cho chúng ta điều này:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thật khó để đưa ra kết luận chỉ từ một biểu đồ này, với khối lượng kết nối và tính toán này, chúng ta đang thấy nhiều việc phải làm hơn với việc thực thi chung các ngôn ngữ, nhiều hơn thế nữa để I/O. Lưu ý rằng các ngôn ngữ được coi là \"scripting languages\" (loose typing, dynamic interpretation) hoạt động chậm nhất.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nhưng điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chúng ta tăng N lên 1000, vẫn với 300 yêu cầu đồng thời - tải như nhau nhưng số lần lặp hash nhiều hơn 100 lần (tải CPU nhiều hơn đáng kể):</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đột nhiên, hiệu suất Node giảm đáng kể, vì các hoạt động đòi hỏi nhiều CPU trong mỗi yêu cầu đang chặn lẫn nhau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bây giờ chúng ta hãy thử 5000 kết nối đồng thời (với N = 1). Thật không may, đối với hầu hết các môi trường này, tỷ lệ thất bại không phải là không đáng kể. Đối với biểu đồ này, chúng tôi sẽ xem xét tổng số yêu cầu mỗi giây. Càng cao càng tốt:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Và bức tranh trông khá khác biệt.. Rõ ràng, Go là người chiến thắng ở đây.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mặc dù có rất nhiều yếu tố liên quan đến throughput tổng thể và cũng rất khác nhau giữa các ứng dụng, nhưng bạn càng hiểu rõ về những gì đang diễn ra và những đánh đổi liên quan, bạn sẽ càng có lợi thế.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"7-golang-vs-nodejs-n%C3%AAn-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng-c%C3%A1i-n%C3%A0o\">7.

NodeJS cung cấp đầy đủ các công cụ và framework để phát triển cả front-end và back-end. Để so sánh, Go không có thư viện GUI (giao diện người dùng) và bạn cần sử dụng thư viện của bên thứ ba. Nếu bạn muốn một bộ ngôn ngữ và framework chỉ dành cho toàn bộ quá trình phát triển ứng dụng web của mình, thì bạn nên sử dụng NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn muốn một ứng dụng có hiệu năng cao và có khả năng mở rộng: Khi bạn xem xét Golang bạn sẽ nghĩ đến khả năng mở rộng và hiệu năng của nó. Trong bài so sánh Go vs NodeJS này, Go làm tốt hơn mặt này so với NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn có các yêu cầu nghiêm ngặt về bảo mật: Go loại bỏ nhiều lỗi lập trình phổ biến, do đó, nó làm giảm các lỗ hổng bảo mật của ứng dụng. Khả năng quản lý bộ nhớ và thu gom rác mạnh mẽ của nó khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn tốt hơn NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn cần real-time data streaming: NodeJS làm tốt hơn Golang về mặt này (dễ phát triển hơn).</li><li>Bạn thích một tập hợp các quy trình phát triển, xem xét, thử nghiệm và triển khai được sắp xếp hợp lý: Bạn nên sử dụng Golang do hỗ trợ công cụ của nó để phân tích, thử nghiệm và triển khai static code. Trong so sánh Go vs NodeJS, Go đại diện cho một sự lựa chọn tốt hơn ở khía cạnh này.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tóm lại, bài viết trên đã phân tích rất kỹ các đặc điểm của cả&nbsp;<strong>NodeJS</strong>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<strong>Golang</strong>.

Tính không đồng bộ của nó loại trừ việc đợi phản hồi từ server - bạn có thể chuyển sang lệnh tiếp theo. Tuy nhiên, khái niệm về vòng lặp sự kiện mà nó sử dụng có thể trở nên khá rắc rối. Khi mọi sự kiện mới được gửi đến cuối hàng đợi, quá trình xử lý trở nên chậm hơn. Điều đó giải thích tại sao NodeJS sẽ không thực sự là ứng dụng phù hợp nhất cho các hoạt động chuyên sâu của bộ xử lý. Điều đó có thể đặt ra một thách thức đối với các nhà phát triển không quen thuộc với lập trình bất đồng bộ.

Bạn có thể sử dụng chúng để hoàn thành nhiều nhiệm vụ và không cần phải viết những đoạn mã phức tạp.</li><li>Go giúp các nhà phát triển viết mã không có lỗi. Vì đó là ngôn ngữ&nbsp;<strong>statically-typed</strong>, bạn sẽ không mắc phải những lỗi phức tạp liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>. Go có tính năng thu gom garbage hiệu quả và hỗ trợ quản lý bộ nhớ an toàn. Tất cả những yếu tố này làm giảm khả năng xuất hiện lỗi.</li><li>Go giúp viết các ứng dụng an toàn và lợi thế này liên quan nhiều đến cách giúp viết mã không có lỗi. Trong thế giới ngày nay, tội phạm mạng không ngừng tìm kiếm những kẽ hở để khám phá trong các ứng dụng phần mềm.

Đó là một thư viện mã nguồn mở cho phép tính toán số. Tuy nhiên, API được cung cấp cho Go sẽ không cho phép các model training. Mà người dùng Go chỉ có thể sử dụng các model đã được train. Cho nên để xác định và đào tạo các model, hầu hết các dev của Go phải sử dụng Python, tải chúng lên Go sau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Còn với NodeJS, bạn có thể tạo các model và train chúng ngay từ đầu nhưng cũng có thể sử dụng lại các model đã được train. Trong trường hợp đó,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>&nbsp;cũng sẽ là một sự lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Vì NodeJS cung cấp nguồn thư viện tốt hơn nên trong khía cạnh&nbsp;<strong>Machine learning</strong>&nbsp;NodeJS có lợi thế hơn Golang. Tuy vậy, cả JavaScript và Go đều không phải là lựa chọn đầu tiên với machine learning.

Golang vs NodeJS: Nên sử dụng cái nào?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Làm cách nào để bạn quyết định có sử dụng Go vs NodeJS không? Hãy sử dụng các yếu tố sau:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Thời gian chờ đợi để tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển ứng dụng Go vs NodeJS: Nếu bạn không có nhiều thời gian để tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển, thì bạn nên chọn NodeJS. Bạn sẽ thấy việc tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển NodeJS dễ dàng hơn các nhà lập trình Golang.</li><li>Bạn chỉ muốn sử dụng một ngôn ngữ: Việc phát triển NodeJS có nghĩa là sử dụng JavaScript cho cả front-end và backend. NodeJS cung cấp đầy đủ các công cụ và framework để phát triển cả front-end và back-end. Để so sánh, Go không có thư viện GUI (giao diện người dùng) và bạn cần sử dụng thư viện của bên thứ ba. Nếu bạn muốn một bộ ngôn ngữ và framework chỉ dành cho toàn bộ quá trình phát triển ứng dụng web của mình, thì bạn nên sử dụng NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn muốn một ứng dụng có hiệu năng cao và có khả năng mở rộng: Khi bạn xem xét Golang bạn sẽ nghĩ đến khả năng mở rộng và hiệu năng của nó. Trong bài so sánh Go vs NodeJS này, Go làm tốt hơn mặt này so với NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn có các yêu cầu nghiêm ngặt về bảo mật: Go loại bỏ nhiều lỗi lập trình phổ biến, do đó, nó làm giảm các lỗ hổng bảo mật của ứng dụng. Khả năng quản lý bộ nhớ và thu gom rác mạnh mẽ của nó khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn tốt hơn NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn cần real-time data streaming: NodeJS làm tốt hơn Golang về mặt này (dễ phát triển hơn).</li><li>Bạn thích một tập hợp các quy trình phát triển, xem xét, thử nghiệm và triển khai được sắp xếp hợp lý: Bạn nên sử dụng Golang do hỗ trợ công cụ của nó để phân tích, thử nghiệm và triển khai static code. Trong so sánh Go vs NodeJS, Go đại diện cho một sự lựa chọn tốt hơn ở khía cạnh này.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tóm lại, bài viết trên đã phân tích rất kỹ các đặc điểm của cả&nbsp;<strong>NodeJS</strong>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<strong>Golang</strong>.

Ví dụ: nếu nhà phát triển đang sử dụng Carbon framework cho trải nghiệm UI, thì việc tải các Carbon component với react là điều quan trọng.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Đường cong học tập:</strong>&nbsp;Đối với một developer mới, việc học Reactjs có thể mất nhiều thời gian hơn so với React Native. Điều đó có nghĩa là đường cong học tập cho Reactjs nhiều hơn và đây có thể là một vấn đề đối với các developer mới đang cố gắng xây dựng một ứng dụng bằng Reactjs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Hỗ trợ thư viện bên ngoài:</strong>&nbsp;Mặc dù Reactjs hỗ trợ rất nhiều thư viện bên ngoài của bên thứ ba, nhưng có rất ít thư viện native dành cho Reactjs. Giờ đây, các thư viện bên ngoài có thể giúp nhà phát triển sử dụng cả các chức năng HTML và CSS và xây dựng nó thành JSX, vốn có độ phức tạp và đường cong học tập dốc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Hệ thống phân cấp dữ liệu dài:</strong>&nbsp;navigation dữ liệu trong Reactjs rất phức tạp. Ví dụ: Reactjs không hỗ trợ xử lý dữ liệu song song, không giống như các công cụ JS Scripting khác. Để navigate từ Div này sang Div khác trong Reactjs, trước tiên người dùng sẽ cần navigate đến parent node, sau đó đến parent node trên cùng và sau đó navigate đến phân cấp thứ hai của tree node.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"h%E1%BA%A1n-ch%E1%BA%BF-c%E1%BB%A7a-react-native\">Hạn chế của React Native</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Thiếu thư viện native</strong>: Trong trường hợp ứng dụng có nhiều chức năng, thì React Native có thể làm chậm quá trình phát triển vì lý do thiếu các thư viện native và phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào thư viện bên thứ ba. Khi một người cần thực hiện các phép tính phức tạp cùng một lúc, Swift, Objective-C và Java được nhận xét là có tốc độ cao hơn, so với JavaScript, vì JavaScript có các chi phí chung trong việc kiểm soát các element native.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Abstraction layer</strong>&nbsp;được tổ chức không chặt chẽ: React Native là một framework được tổ chức không chặt chẽ, trong đó các lập trình viên có thể lấy các thẻ như HTML, stylesheets như CSS và code từ Javascript. Đây có vẻ là một khía cạnh tích cực, vì nó cung cấp nhiều tự do hơn cho các developer, nhưng đồng thời, nó cũng đặt ra những thách thức.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ví dụ: không giống như các ngôn ngữ Swift và Java, nó không thực thi bất kỳ tham số hoặc quy tắc nào và thực tế mà nói, tại bất kỳ thời điểm nào, một biến có thể là bất kỳ thứ gì theo nghĩa đen. Điều này có thể gây ra xung đột về logic, điều này khó có thể xảy ra với Swift hoặc Java.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Mất nhiều thời gian hơn để khởi tạo:</strong>&nbsp;Vấn đề với React Native là mất nhiều thời gian hơn để khởi tạo runtime cho các tiện ích và thiết bị. Vấn đề này chủ yếu là do chuỗi JavaScript cần thời gian để khởi tạo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Yêu cầu nhiều cách giải quyết native:</strong>&nbsp;Nếu không tìm thấy chức năng cụ thể nào trong React Native, thì các developer có hai lựa chọn: Viết các native modules trong Swift/Objective-C và Java hoặc yêu cầu bất kỳ native developer nào viết một cái mới. Nói một cách dễ hiểu, React Native làm tăng chi phí cả về chi phí và thời gian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Các vấn đề về Giấy phép &amp; Bằng sáng chế:</strong>&nbsp;Các vấn đề về Giấy phép và Bằng sáng chế cũng vẫn tồn tại và vì Facebook kiểm soát React Native nên vấn đề này sẽ không sớm được giải quyết. Giờ đây, React Native đã nhận được Phiên bản 2, Cấp bổ sung Quyền Sáng chế từ Facebook cùng với giấy phép kiểu BSD.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nhưng vào năm 2017, Facebook đã cập nhật Bằng sáng chế và cấp phép nguồn mở cho React Native, cũng như Reactjs và các dự án nguồn mở khác. Theo bản cập nhật mới này, trong trường hợp bất kỳ developer nào sử dụng các nền tảng mã nguồn mở này cho bất kỳ mục đích nào mà Facebook không thích hoặc vi phạm bằng sáng chế, thì Facebook có quyền ngăn developer đó sử dụng nền tảng mã nguồn mở đó. Điều này đã ảnh hưởng đến cả các developer Reactjs và React Native, vì các ứng dụng của họ được phát triển trên các nền tảng này có thể thực sự bị ngừng hoạt động bất cứ lúc nào.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"c%C3%B4ng-ngh%E1%BB%87-n%C3%A0o-t%E1%BB%91t-h%C6%A1n-reactjs-hay-react-native\">Công nghệ nào tốt hơn ReactJS hay React Native?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cả Reactjs và React Native đều là những trụ cột quan trọng để phát triển ứng dụng và web, và do các chức năng linh hoạt của chúng và hệ thống thư viện sinh thái đang phát triển, chúng cũng đang trên đà phát triển từng ngày.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trong khi Reactjs về cơ bản là một thư viện JavaScript và React Native là toàn bộ framework, thì cái trước là trung tâm của cái sau, và bổ trợ lẫn nhau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nếu Reactjs là tối ưu để tạo các ứng dụng có chức năng cao và tính toán phức tạp, thì React Native lý tưởng để mang lại cảm giác native cho các ứng dụng dành cho thiết bị di động của bạn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mọi công nghệ hoặc framework trong thế giới của các developer đều có một số hạn chế, Reactjs và React Native cũng vậy.

Trong khi trong react native, native APIs được sử dụng để render components trong mobile.</li><li>Các ứng dụng được phát triển bằng Reactjs thì render HTML trong UI. Trong khi, React Native sử dụng JSX để render UI và nó không có gì khác ngoài javascript.</li><li>CSS được sử dụng để tạo styling trong Reactjs trong khi stylesheet được dùng để styling trong React Native.</li><li>Trong Reactjs, có thể tạo animation bằng cách sử dụng CSS, giống như việc phát triển web. Trong khi React Native, một animated API được sử dụng để tạo animation trên các component khác nhau của ứng dụng React Native.</li><li>Nếu nhu cầu là xây dựng giao diện người dùng có hiệu năng cao, dynamic và responsive cho các giao diện web thì Reactjs là lựa chọn tốt nhất.

Trước khi bắt đầu làm việc với hai công nghệ này, các developer phải hiểu rõ những hạn chế đó để chuẩn bị kế hoạch khắc phục.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m-c%E1%BB%A7a-reactjs\">Nhược điểm của ReactJS</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Chi phí và thời gian có thể bị vượt mức:&nbsp;</strong>Thông thường, việc tải xuống một thư viện react khác trở nên cần thiết, điều này làm tăng chi phí và thời gian. Ví dụ: nếu nhà phát triển đang sử dụng Carbon framework cho trải nghiệm UI, thì việc tải các Carbon component với react là điều quan trọng.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Đường cong học tập:</strong>&nbsp;Đối với một developer mới, việc học Reactjs có thể mất nhiều thời gian hơn so với React Native. Điều đó có nghĩa là đường cong học tập cho Reactjs nhiều hơn và đây có thể là một vấn đề đối với các developer mới đang cố gắng xây dựng một ứng dụng bằng Reactjs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Hỗ trợ thư viện bên ngoài:</strong>&nbsp;Mặc dù Reactjs hỗ trợ rất nhiều thư viện bên ngoài của bên thứ ba, nhưng có rất ít thư viện native dành cho Reactjs. Giờ đây, các thư viện bên ngoài có thể giúp nhà phát triển sử dụng cả các chức năng HTML và CSS và xây dựng nó thành JSX, vốn có độ phức tạp và đường cong học tập dốc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Hệ thống phân cấp dữ liệu dài:</strong>&nbsp;navigation dữ liệu trong Reactjs rất phức tạp. Ví dụ: Reactjs không hỗ trợ xử lý dữ liệu song song, không giống như các công cụ JS Scripting khác. Để navigate từ Div này sang Div khác trong Reactjs, trước tiên người dùng sẽ cần navigate đến parent node, sau đó đến parent node trên cùng và sau đó navigate đến phân cấp thứ hai của tree node.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"h%E1%BA%A1n-ch%E1%BA%BF-c%E1%BB%A7a-react-native\">Hạn chế của React Native</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Thiếu thư viện native</strong>: Trong trường hợp ứng dụng có nhiều chức năng, thì React Native có thể làm chậm quá trình phát triển vì lý do thiếu các thư viện native và phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào thư viện bên thứ ba. Khi một người cần thực hiện các phép tính phức tạp cùng một lúc, Swift, Objective-C và Java được nhận xét là có tốc độ cao hơn, so với JavaScript, vì JavaScript có các chi phí chung trong việc kiểm soát các element native.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Abstraction layer</strong>&nbsp;được tổ chức không chặt chẽ: React Native là một framework được tổ chức không chặt chẽ, trong đó các lập trình viên có thể lấy các thẻ như HTML, stylesheets như CSS và code từ Javascript. Đây có vẻ là một khía cạnh tích cực, vì nó cung cấp nhiều tự do hơn cho các developer, nhưng đồng thời, nó cũng đặt ra những thách thức.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ví dụ: không giống như các ngôn ngữ Swift và Java, nó không thực thi bất kỳ tham số hoặc quy tắc nào và thực tế mà nói, tại bất kỳ thời điểm nào, một biến có thể là bất kỳ thứ gì theo nghĩa đen. Điều này có thể gây ra xung đột về logic, điều này khó có thể xảy ra với Swift hoặc Java.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Mất nhiều thời gian hơn để khởi tạo:</strong>&nbsp;Vấn đề với React Native là mất nhiều thời gian hơn để khởi tạo runtime cho các tiện ích và thiết bị. Vấn đề này chủ yếu là do chuỗi JavaScript cần thời gian để khởi tạo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Yêu cầu nhiều cách giải quyết native:</strong>&nbsp;Nếu không tìm thấy chức năng cụ thể nào trong React Native, thì các developer có hai lựa chọn: Viết các native modules trong Swift/Objective-C và Java hoặc yêu cầu bất kỳ native developer nào viết một cái mới. Nói một cách dễ hiểu, React Native làm tăng chi phí cả về chi phí và thời gian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Các vấn đề về Giấy phép &amp; Bằng sáng chế:</strong>&nbsp;Các vấn đề về Giấy phép và Bằng sáng chế cũng vẫn tồn tại và vì Facebook kiểm soát React Native nên vấn đề này sẽ không sớm được giải quyết. Giờ đây, React Native đã nhận được Phiên bản 2, Cấp bổ sung Quyền Sáng chế từ Facebook cùng với giấy phép kiểu BSD.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nhưng vào năm 2017, Facebook đã cập nhật Bằng sáng chế và cấp phép nguồn mở cho React Native, cũng như Reactjs và các dự án nguồn mở khác. Theo bản cập nhật mới này, trong trường hợp bất kỳ developer nào sử dụng các nền tảng mã nguồn mở này cho bất kỳ mục đích nào mà Facebook không thích hoặc vi phạm bằng sáng chế, thì Facebook có quyền ngăn developer đó sử dụng nền tảng mã nguồn mở đó. Điều này đã ảnh hưởng đến cả các developer Reactjs và React Native, vì các ứng dụng của họ được phát triển trên các nền tảng này có thể thực sự bị ngừng hoạt động bất cứ lúc nào.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"c%C3%B4ng-ngh%E1%BB%87-n%C3%A0o-t%E1%BB%91t-h%C6%A1n-reactjs-hay-react-native\">Công nghệ nào tốt hơn ReactJS hay React Native?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cả Reactjs và React Native đều là những trụ cột quan trọng để phát triển ứng dụng và web, và do các chức năng linh hoạt của chúng và hệ thống thư viện sinh thái đang phát triển, chúng cũng đang trên đà phát triển từng ngày.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trong khi Reactjs về cơ bản là một thư viện JavaScript và React Native là toàn bộ framework, thì cái trước là trung tâm của cái sau, và bổ trợ lẫn nhau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nếu Reactjs là tối ưu để tạo các ứng dụng có chức năng cao và tính toán phức tạp, thì React Native lý tưởng để mang lại cảm giác native cho các ứng dụng dành cho thiết bị di động của bạn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mọi công nghệ hoặc framework trong thế giới của các developer đều có một số hạn chế, Reactjs và React Native cũng vậy.

Tuy nhiên, khi gặp những việc nhỏ, bạn nên nhân nhượng để tăng thêm lòng tin của đối phương thì bạn nên để đối phương giành phần thắng.

Còn Storage giống như tủ lạnh để chứa sau khi sơ chế xong.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mặc dù không hình dung được chi tiết sự vận hành thực tế, nhưng bằng việc liên hệ với công việc nấu nướng của mình, một người nội trợ cũng có thể dễ dàng hình dung được vai trò của từng bộ phận đó trong máy tính. Đó&nbsp;là tiền&nbsp;đề&nbsp;cho việc tiếp nhận các thông tin tiếp theo một cách dễ dàng hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Qua ví dụ này có thể thấy rằng, Metaphor không chỉ đơn giản là việc&nbsp;<strong>lựa chọn các hình tượng có tính tương đồng để mô tả lẫn nhau</strong>. Mà điều quan trọng là ta phải biết đứng vào hoàn cảnh của người nghe để lựa chọn hình tượng gần gũi với họ (như việc sử dụng việc chế biến món ăn cho đối tượng người nội trợ). Khi đó ta mới có thể thu được những hiệu quả thực sự trong việc sử dụng Metaphor.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Kết luận</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Khi truyền đạt một nội dung nào đó hãy đặt cho mình câu hỏi : “Người nghe có thực sự cần những nội dung này không?”. Nó sẽ giúp ta chọn lựa được những nội dung chia sẻ phù hợp nhất mang lại giá trị cho câu chuyện. Và khi loay hoay không biết làm thế nào để trình bày những điều này một cách tốt nhất đừng quên chúng ta có “<strong>5W1H</strong>” và “<strong>Metaphor</strong>” nhé.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Tham khảo:</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Phong cách làm việc với khách hàng Nhật – 5W1H</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Kĩ năng truyền đạt trong Giao tiếp','','inherit','closed','closed','','61-revision-v1','','','2022-09-05 06:25:15','2022-09-05 06:25:15','',61,'http://localhost/?p=62',0,'revision','',0);
