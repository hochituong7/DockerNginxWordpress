And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp.

He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&amp;speakers=bud-kraus\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global reach and meaning through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus with Josepha\" class=\"wp-image-13342\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus with Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WordCamp Montclair, NJ 2022</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress.

It’s also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world from my <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&amp;speakers=bud-kraus\">talks and presentations</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone within the WordPress community check to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would love your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is planned for official release on May 24th, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further.

Ny</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> good morning, Dan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right. It\'s gonna be a busy, busy week prepping for travel to, um, word camp us. I\'m I\'m sure you\'re running fast and. hopefully getting some, some rest in there too, but how, how are things going</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> on there? I actually am getting rest. I think the holiday helped, but yeah, I\'m definitely running around like a chicken with a Ted cut off and , I\'m hoping I don\'t forget to pack anything, but I\'m very excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to be my first big word camp and my first time in San Diego. So I\'m super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, me too. Yeah. I. haven\'t been down LA in a while, but yeah, never San Diego and first word camp. Um, yeah, the labor day was nice. It\'s one of those, uh, Canada has every province finds a way to have a, a long weekend every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have a, there\'s always a Monday in the month off and they coincide with the us one. It probably as much as possible, although Thanksgiving is totally different time and oh yeah. so it\'s, it\'s interesting when you, you really, the rest of the world gets dragged along by the us holiday schedule, especially the big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopping ones and you know, nothing stops, email, doesn\'t stop, everything keeps going. And you know, sometimes it\'s a, it\'s a family day or , you know, a long weekend and no one else is, is, uh, aware of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> It sounds lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It can be, yeah. I I\'ve been slow to, to adjust to it. They kind of sneak up on me. well, what are you, what are you anticipating doing at, um, at word camp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are you looking forward to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m looking forward to meeting a lot more people in the community. I\'ve only met a lot of people through, um, like Twitter, mostly and you know, the occasional popup on a podcast. So I\'m really excited to meet different people and talk with them and pick their brains. Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In private. So that\'s going to be very awesome. What about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, there\'s some, some lots of good talks. I\'m. wondering how I can fit that in and the hallway stuff. And there I\'ve, I\'ve met a, a number of our, our members and people. I happened to have known for a long time earlier this year at one, at a retreat we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but yeah, there will be a lot of people I meet for the first time. And it just, it seems like a lot to try to fit in at one point, but I\'m looking forward to contributor day where maybe someone where I can get, I can get. Oriented and, and doing something helpful. I, I, I really wanna get some time to, um, figure out how to ease into, to some things I can help with on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s just been kind of nuts lately. So that\'s been tricky. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s gonna be awesome. I\'m really looking forward to that as well. Like I think with all of us in a room, it\'ll be a little easier than trying to, you know, do it over at the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah. Yeah. There\'s so much stuff that can be explained directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Synchronis communication at least, or if someone right there at your shoulder, um, that, you know, one more tab, one more thing to read. You know, I find like after, you know, after the productive hours of, of work 3, 4, 5 hours of if it\'s reading intensive and man, I just have to read a lot of stuff. It, you just lose that attention and processing ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Do you find that? Do you just. Where you\'re trying to read, you\'re scanning through something and you just like, what, what am I, oh yeah. What is, what was this about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And constantly starting over. Oh yeah. it happens a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> and when you\'re actually trying to learn a workflow or a process or a tool or something like that, you kind of want to get it in muscle memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You wanna get it, or in some kind of whatever, part of your brain where you just don\'t have to like driving, you don\'t have to think about it. And, um, yeah, it\'s good to do that. First thing in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, is this your first work camp? Like big one? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> of any of any really? Um, when I was, um, first lived in a, in a city that was big enough to have things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I don\'t, I don\'t think Milwaukee\'s ever had a. I don\'t know. I wouldn\'t, I shouldn\'t say that there there\'s, there\'s a ton of WordPress people there mm-hmm um, I don\'t know if they\'ve had a, a word camp, but they didn\'t back then. So I was the, the little open source tech scene was taking off and it was mostly DRAL people around the Makerspace and those of us who did things in WordPress, where, um, well, WordPress was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite young at that point, I was more into Jula.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was that going on? So, you know, there was, there was kind of a general, there was a, um, bar camp that was a big deal, um, bar camp. What is that have bar camps like food bar? It was, um, it was not a platform specific thing, but it was getting dominated by the local Dal people and, uh, which I was totally into as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it was a more general, um, uh, coder camp hacker kind of hacker space filled up with tons of kids and. You know, we\'re all younger then. Um, and I\'m yeah. I\'m, I\'m curious about the age demographics, uh, you know, I, I feel WordPress and word camps. We really need to, um, find ways to diversify in all directions, including oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, I\'m definitely interested in that as well. my, um, husband actually asked me, he was like, is gonna be a lot of people your age. And I was like, I don\'t know. Um, you know, , I know in some people at the company, my age that are going, but I was like, I don\'t know. I was like, this is going to be an interesting experience and it\'s not just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ve been to a lot of other big, uh, tech conventions though, and conferences and meetups mm-hmm and they\'ve been pretty diverse in terms of age, um, even race as well. I\'m really interested to see how work camp compares, especially since I\'m going to all things open in November. I\'m really excited for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s in Raleigh. and yeah, I\'m just very excited for my first work camp. I\'m I\'m already like prepping to go to work camp Asia as well. So hopefully it just blows my mind and I wanna go to all of them. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> wish, I wish I, well, I may be a few more here and there, but yeah, I\'d love to, um, yeah, Raleigh, I lived there for a number of years and university years and they\'re not real nice, nice place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\'ll have to write about that or tell us all about the all things. Yeah, we\'ll talk about it. Mm-hmm um, but more of a broad creator, uh, economy focused conference, I think. Right. Um, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, all things open source mm-hmm yeah. Yeah. So yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> age diversity is great. I like it. I I\'ve enjoyed when I went back to classroom university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching part-time a few years back after raising my own kids. And it was totally different than when like 20 years before when I had started. And hadn\'t, you know, I was, I was barely older than my students. um, I don\'t know. The dead perspective is sometimes nice when you\'ve meowed out and understand people need connection and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of technical skill, you know, otherwise they just think you\'re saying you\'re doing everything wrong. Mm-hmm and yeah. So it\'s, it\'s great to have all, all ages. I love having older people around too, for their experience and usually come or</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> approach. Are you, are you going to be in dad mode at work camp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I don\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I don\'t know where I. I can come in at all. never really know. It depends on how much I sleep and I don\'t think there\'s that much sleeping that happens when you\'ve got party after party. Another other things going on. Um, yeah, I\'ll try to. Keep the energy up, but I\'m old. I ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you\'re not old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, I can fool people, but oh yeah. It\'s an old,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> so when we get to karaoke and it\'s time for our duet, I don\'t wanna hear you say, oh, now I can\'t do this. I\'m tired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you pick a song yet? You got a place</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> where I have six or seven songs. So you can\'t tell me no, like, I\'m gonna say Dan, like you can\'t say no to all six</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> or seven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. As soon as I open my mouth, though, you\'re gonna be like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That\'s it? No, no, no. That\'s, that\'s what karaoke is for you. Don\'t take people who can sing to karaoke. That\'s the worst. That ruins karaoke</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> ah, yeah. Yeah. I haven\'t been in to one in a while. I like watching \'em there\'s a, a terrible place to eat dive bar, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they\'ve like two kinds of bad Canadian beer. Okay. Downtown here. And it\'s just a weird place, but it\'s, it\'s right down from a, a, a. tall building that has a, a lot of retired people in it. And there were these, um, cute elderly ladies that would, would come down there and do do it along with, it was just the weirdest group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all ages and all love it kinds. And so, you know, some people were really fabulous at it and others were just fabulously. amateur and, um, you never know what you\'d get. It was, it was just great to watch. Um, I, I don\'t know that I\'ve seen that many. I\'ve definitely seen some, uh, in-home large house party, Asian karaoke that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it was just a D totally different thing. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I love it. We, we did Korean style karaoke in Vegas. And when was that? March? Oh my God. I loved it so much. We just had like buckets of Soju and like, we were singing all night and dancing. I had a tambourine. It was so great. I slept in the Uber on the way back to the whole hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>was wonderful. there\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> always someone who, who thinks they\'re really good and is really earnest. And they\'re, you know, the dog\'s starting to how and .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, that\'s me. That\'s me. Oh, that\'s me. I can\'t wait. Oh, that\'s me. I\'m ready. I\'m ready. I\'m so ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, I know. Mm. Yeah, I was, I was not trained properly, but at, at any kind of music really too bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My, my girls are, they\'ve had tons of tons of musical. Instruction, which they enjoy. But now I, I wanna kick their, their butts out into the street for busking. You can get be a licensed busker in Edmonton, in the summers. Um, but that\'s a totally different thing when you\'re performing live with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s a big, big confidence jump. Even if you do have the skills confidence. You gotta, you gotta push yourself out there and do it, I guess. So it\'s not, not my thing, but I wish I wish I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, we will make them proud this year. Somehow. See if someone gets video, it\'ll be okay. Oh, well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> if anything ends up on the internet, that might be bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m I\'m not gonna share</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that. No it for, okay. We\'ll discuss this later, so, okay. What speakers or sessions are you most excited to see at word? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I want, well I\'m Robert Rowley is a fun, you know, wild and crazy guy. I\'ve enjoyed talking books and random things with, and, and security is he he\'s with he\'s the security advocate at patch stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. Uh, he\'s, he\'s giving a talk. He did a really cool, crazy thing he\'s done before he did for us, but he he\'s done mm-hmm before where he teaches lock, picking, it\'s sort of a side hobby and he uses it to talk about security and philosophy of life and, and all kinds of, um, things like that. And so I\'m sure he\'s gonna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entertaining and interesting. And it\'s, it\'s just security is a topic. I, I really like, and I\'ve paid more attention cuz he writes in podcasts about it quite a bit. Um, patch stack has a really cool, um, approach where they\'re, they\'re really encouraging collaboration through a network that they, um, I don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it\'s a very, it\'s an open network. They sponsored, I, I guess they\'re kind of the ringleader, but anyone can, can join in the security profession and try to work to keep WordPress safe. I know they just, um, they partnered with hosting her to provide their, um, services. Um, both of those companies are, um, I think lot Vian, uh, mm-hmm multi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>business members of, of post status. And they\'re, it\'s nice to see people get together and collaborate. And so they\'re providing it is security, uh, heads up, Hey, update your stuff inside your hosting panel, if you\'re with hosting or, and I noticed that that last little, there was three security, um, uh, patches in the, the little maintenance and security release that, that went out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm. the other day, a few days ago, last week. Um, and you don\'t initially find out all the details about it. And Robert later, um, commented on it, that they were actually, the security stuff was, was hunted down. There\'s a WordPress bug bounty program. Google has one too, where you can get mm-hmm money by finding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was, it was something that couldn\'t actually likely be exploited, but, um, within the parameters of, I guess, finding. Some kind of proof of concept that something could be exploited under certain conditions. You, you know, they, they patch that, check it out, learn some things. And, uh, so I think everyone usually assumes that there\'s something bad going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like some bad guys found something or it\'s, it\'s at risk. And sometimes it\'s just penetration testing analysis from the good guys and then they\'re fixing it so nice. It should be good press when, when things get better and stronger, uh, what\'s your number one session, man? I like there\'s all kinds of good stuff in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think my favorite, favorite, favorite? is an anthropologist, a WordPress developer and a lawyer walking to a bar. Mm. Yeah. Cassandra Decker is doing that one about just communicating in the community, which is something I actually wrote about this, um, wrote about this week. And it talks about how to talk about talk with people in the community that may be from different walks of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that title really caught my eye because. I was interested in all three of these careers at one point, you know, I am a WordPress developer now I was interested in being an anthropologist. I even learned Latin for it. oh, really? And the, yeah, I\'m reading the Hobbit in Latin right now. My Latin is like S shotty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a while ago, but I\'m trying to relearn it. So I\'m reading the Hobbit in Latin and then I also was accepted in the law school, but I didn\'t. So I was like, oh, I\'m really, I\'m really interested in this. And I\'m interested in what she has to say. And, you know, it\'s always, I\'m always interested in opening up communication in the community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s my absolute favorite. I\'m not missing that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. That sounds really interesting. I love it. When people do interdisciplinary things or break out of the bubble and, and stuff like that. Mm-hmm , um, I, I didn\'t know that. So, you know, you\'re such. Non argumentative personality. I wouldn\'t think law would be attractive to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you making</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> fun of me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, you\'d be a great lawyer. Um, you\'re making</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> fun of me. Oh my God. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Latin. Um, yeah, I, I had to crash course one summer. Um, when I was doing, I did up to some level of, of graduate work in literature and. Literary cultural studies and Renaissance medieval stuff. And yeah, so we have these odd, odd backgrounds we could have might have explored at at one point, but language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never really, you can\'t never go wrong. Like that\'s just cool to know, but you must be pretty good if you can read any of, of the Hobbit in, in Latin, which is crazy because Tolkin. Was this major, you know, Brian has probably, if, if you\'re not a token buff, Brian cords is probably said quite a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He seems to be quite a fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Mm. Um, I, I really like him a lot. Um, my grandmother actually, she had a copy of the Hobbit. I started reading. I tried to read when I was really young and I was like, okay, that goes back on the shelf. And then I read at a later age. So in order to help, I also have it in Spanish. I can speak Spanish and speaking Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess my limited English I\'m, I\'m joking. Um, Latin comes. It comes kind of easy when I can recognize it, you know, in different languages and I\'m learning Korean right now, so, oh yeah, I know that right. Duo. Yeah. So I\'ll probably eventually get the ho in Korean. So I guess</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the Hobbit would be easier than Lord of the rings cuz oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah. I was trying to imagine, like, how would you do Latin? Does Tolkin knew so many languages? Mm-hmm and then he makes. All these Elish languages and different ways of writing it, the war and, or, oh yeah. All these things. Like how, how would you flatten that? All I\'ve always been curious about that. I, haven\'t not gotten fluent enough in another language to really feel, you know, like how do, when you\'re representing an, a different language mm-hmm, in your own language, like, um, Hemingway like used these and thousand and stuff when he\'s like, I think people are speaking in Spanish and, and things, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it was in for whom the bell tolls mm-hmm how do you indicate a foreign language? You can do kind of dialect or accents and stuff, but, um, that would be tough, especially to learn, I guess, you know, you\'re fluent. If you\'re reading a foreign language and you\'re reading their creative manipulation of it to pretend to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>doing another foreign language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. The books I have. Um, I read them on my iPad because, you know, anytime I don\'t understand anything, I can just click and find the word or find the, a reference for the phrase. But they\'re geared toward people who already speak English, who are trained to learn these other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it was something I discovered, cuz I was gonna start with children\'s book. I was like, okay, I\'ll get like cat and a hat in Latin and stuff like that, which I did find some of those as well. And then it was like some people have, they were like the. It\'s written in different languages and, um, they have learning ones geared toward English speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, oh my God. Yes. Cause I love the habit. I was reading it like every year at one point. So it was like, I\'m, I\'m so familiar with it in English, maybe, you know, it\'ll help. And then like I was on the first page in Latin for like three days. I was like, okay, let\'s just break all of this down. And then Spanish, you know, I was going a little faster cuz I can read Spanish, probably the best I can speak it, but I can read it the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s just getting a really familiar. That you\'re really familiar with and going for it in a different language. I feel like that\'s very helpful. You know, the most helpful is talking to people, but the second most helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, yeah, I, I envy that. I wish I, um, had time to go back and, and do more of languages and, and just reading, um, books, uh, and fiction again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I was, yeah, early, that was one of the, the first big books. I read all the tol and stuff. And we had a record, my brother and I , we had a record where it was a, it was like, it was based on the cartoon version of the Hobbit and the dramatic reading. Yeah. I\'ve seen it. Yeah. I could probably do the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> love it. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Well, what else is is cool in, in here? I know, um, Molana cap is, is doing, is teaching, um, WP CLI do you use that at all? I\'ve it\'s been a long time since I played around with it, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I do, I do cool. it doesn\'t make me the happiest, but I do. Cool. No, it\'s cool. I it\'s, I, I know it\'s useful. I just it\'s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, yeah, it\'s not WSP CLI it\'s me. I\'m the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> She\'s on that. I know that one kind of jumped. Oh, and the performance, there\'s a performance session with the Felix arts toos going to he\'s on the performance team and has had a, a lot to contribute on that. So, um, I\'m not sure. I guess, talking, talking about, um, performance at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m not sure if this is geared towards probably developers. Hosting people. I\'m just, I\'m curious what, what I might learn there. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I like a WordPress for the next generation. Mm. Um, that\'s the one I\'m very interested in. I think Columbia, I\'m so sorry if I say your name, wrong Hodge is doing it. Just talking about, um, entry, uh, barriers for young people and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I talk a lot about that. I\'m very excited and, um, it\'s going to be a business talk. So I\'m very excited to go to that one as well, and like soak up knowledge so I can like turn around and use it to help people that\'s get into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s really, I important. Have you, so you\'re the meetups that you\'re working on starting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How how\'s that going along? Do you think you\'ll reach a younger demographic with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, I\'ve had, um, there are people who weren\'t even that I\'m mentoring in tech that weren\'t interested in. WordPress. They\'re interested in now solely after everything I\'ve said to them solely because they know that we\'re, they\'re going to be meetups near them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they know that they\'ll be, you know, someone nearby to talk to. About getting into the community versus trying to do it all online. As we talk about, it\'s so hard to get it\'s. So it\'s hard for people in the community to kind of branch out and communicate online. So imagine how hard it is for people who are new and, you know, just having that in person meet up or that person nearby and to be able to meet other people in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s already getting people, you know, my age and younger, who wants to come into the community. So I think it\'s going to be like a big push for word present in these areas that I\'m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Yeah, that\'s really needed. And, um, I hope, hope we\'ll hear more about the mentoring program that Josepha floated on, on Twitter says his, um, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> In the words I\'m so excited. I\'m so excited about that. I cannot wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Um, really, really an important one, I think. And cuz it does so many things at, at once it\'s um, this just good for people and, and. Relationships, um, anchors people in meaning and, and value that, um, you know, it\'s very basic human stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if we were just training people, technically, you know, that\'s, that\'s not that that\'s not that interesting. Yeah. Mm-hmm ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I mean, it\'s needed to, but yeah, you\'re right. It\'s not that interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, it\'s always an open source. It\'s always tended to. A culture and belonging mm-hmm and, um, mentoring is really what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a better way to, to approach it, um, to give people not just training options, but relationship options, where you\'re learning from a real person, who\'s connects to other people in this cooperative project. That\'s that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, I\'m really excited. This is to be so awesome. Like, I, I don\'t sound as excited as I am because I\'m tired, but I will have energy Thursday when I get there Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Do I get there Thursday? I should probably look into that. It\'s Tuesday, but yeah, I will have a lot of energy when I get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I don\'t miss. All right. Miss your flight. Uh</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh yeah, no, I\'m flying with, uh, one of my coworkers, so she\'s not gonna let me miss my flight. Thank God. How long</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is it for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You prob you might have further to go than, than me. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it\'s only four and a half hours. Five. You gotta direct know it\'s not five, four and a half. Yeah, I got, I got a nonstop direct from Charlotte. So I\'m only 15 minutes away from the airport. I discovered this weekend when I was picking my brother and uncle up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am not far at all from the airport. That is lovely because when I stayed in South Carolina, I would have to drive either an hour and a half to Charlotte to FL somewhere or two hours to Charleston. And it sucked . So it was a all day travel event to go places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. That\'s. Eh, travel can be the older you get the, not such a fun thing, but, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, it\'s better without kids along some of the time, but uh, older, older kids. Um, but I\'m going on my own, but yeah, no direct flights anymore. Uh, from, from here, I, I don\'t think, but it\'s about six hours altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> What\'s the first thing you\'re doing when you, when you land, like what, what\'s the first thing you want to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Huh? I don\'t know. I\'ll just, uh, I\'ll get over to the place, get over to the joint and unpack, uh, see what\'s going on. I\'m sure people will be pretty well assembled by then. um, gotcha. The town and country. Um, I don\'t know if I don\'t get I\'ll probably want, want to quick do that and then find somewhere to. Um, late or, well, I\'ll probably do that in the way it\'ll be fairly late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\'t know. It might just step out. That\'s so interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. We, there might be like good, good night street food. I don\'t know. This is my first time in San Diego. I\'m really excited. So. , I don\'t know the first thing I\'m doing. I think I\'m enjoying being in California. I love California. I don\'t care what part put me in it I\'ll go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s my first thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I never really been in the Northern end of it. It would probably be more my speed. I don\'t know, originally from the Northeast and a lot of time in the Midwest and in south it\'s, uh, I\'m kind of biased on the Eastern end of the the country and, um, people who aren\'t that relaxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> whatever</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I need. I need a certain amount of road rage around, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, oh, I\'m sure you\'ll get that. I feel like , that\'s that\'s American the American way. No,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I don\'t miss that, but you know, I, I did like the Northeastern, um, punchiness of, oh, it\'s not necessarily unfriendly, but willingness to engage with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Blunt, blunt, strangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. The. Seinfeld experience isn\'t too, too far off the reality, or maybe as it used to be. I, I always enjoy, um, living in a, in a city where you can\'t really control or predict, predict what\'s gonna happen in public space. And, um, for all the soup around here, I haven\'t found a soup Nazi yet, but there\'s usually there\'s usually a good place or some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food mogul who controls access to the, the good bond me or something like that. And you gotta please them to make sure. You\'re getting the good stuff</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> now I\'m hungry. I love bombing. I\'m so hungry. Yeah. I that\'s, I really want to, yeah. I wanna try like good Italian and Mexican. I heard it\'s really good in San Diego, but also I wanna try some really good, different Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my, I don\'t know if I\'ll have enough stomach for</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'ll follow you around. Yeah. I\'ve. Enjoy that a lot too. And Edmonton\'s great for all things, Asian and really just in general, it\'s surprising. Um, when you move out here, not knowing anything about it, how much, uh, how much there is and good eats, um, Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. The tacos. Um, I\'ve been making margaritas lately cuz the summer\'s ending and I don\'t know, I just got inspired to, uh, to do that. It\'s a really nice drink. I, Milwaukee was great for Mexican. I missed a lot of the places that were were there. That\'s and they\'re a little weak on that. Maybe here. There\'s a few good few good places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, I guess next week, we\'re going to talk about like food, right? Like where we ate at work camp. mm-hmm yeah, this is where the word press community ate during word camp with Dan and I, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> like it. I know there\'s a contingent. That\'s all interested in the, um, in and out burger. I don\'t know if they\'re big Laki fans, but I\'ve never been to an in and out burger, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I love in and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eat it every time I go to the west coast, I have to eat it like. It\'s not, I couldn\'t even tell you why it\'s so good. It\'s like, not even great, but I love it. And I\'m yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Hmm. I don\'t have to try it. I, I don\'t know. I mean, I\'m neutral. um, sounds kind of like the white castle, you know, for. Chicago people. Um, don\'t get a bunch of sliders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the first time as a kid, when I was Chicago, you have to go to white, white castle. Um, I don\'t know if that\'s even a thing anymore. I miss, um, I haven\'t heard people mention that in a long time. And man from North Carolina, I don\'t, I, I miss the, just the. Franchise unpredictable barbecues and big victims and spicy stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, BOJ angles had was really good. Hot curly fries, poor BOJ</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> angles. what that, yeah. That\'s where everybody comes here and wants Bojangles. Um, is that considered</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> good? My brother walked there when he was in high school once and he\'d get all these bags of curly fries. The only thing I liked. Oh. And.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone had like milkshakes with big chunks of peach in them in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> the summer cook cookout, cookout. That\'s what people like here. They like to come get cookout and Bojangles mm-hmm Bojangles is good. I do like Bojangles cookout is okay. Um, I, I see the, I see the nostalgia and stuff. Why people like it personally, and I hope nobody from North Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is like listening in, sorry, Dan. I think the barbecue is way better in South Carolina. I have not been inspired yet to eat more barbecue here. I\'m actually like every time I go home, I eat barbecue cuz I\'m like, I just can\'t eat it in North Carolina, but it\'s only been a month. I\'ll give North Carolina about two more chances to get me some good barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be true,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but I\'d take, I take anything. No, one\'s no one\'s doing it up. Um, no, that, that was the Mississippi culture guaranteed that there was always a Sunday Southern barbecue somewhere in Milwaukee. Mm-hmm but uh, I\'ve missed. a long time since then. And you might be right. I was in Aiken, uh, outside Columbia mm-hmm South Carolina, 1993 in the summer at this that\'s a beautiful old town, these big streets and trees pre automobile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and there was a staying at this kind of cool little. Old fashioned estate that is probably as old as the town. And, uh, they brought in a, um, a, uh, bluegrass band and, you know, roasting the pig in the mm-hmm back garden for eight hours or so, I dunno, it takes a long time. Um, yeah, that was good. That\'s the most memorable one I\'ve I\'ve been at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah. You gotta come to South Carolina. I would invite you now, but it\'s like two last minute, but you know, SU the Southern funeral. So I\'ve been back and forth for a funeral arrangements and oh yeah. When I, last time I went, they had burnt ends, macaroni and cheese, barbecue hash, and like chopped barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hash rice, which people probably don\'t know what hash is outside of the south. Mm. Um, uh, they had cream corn and like stuffing and, uh, coleslaw and baked beans and ribs. And I was like, oh my God. Yeah. Somebody make a, made a five. Flavored pound cake. Like I was like, I gotta go. Y\'all like, I\'ve gained too much weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I have to go. I have to see people this week. Like my cheeks are swollen. Like everybody know let\'s everybody stop cooking. And then they\'re like, well, we\'re frying chicken tomorrow. Please stop everybody. Stop. please. You</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> got reminded of your mortality. You may as well eat well</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you\'re right. Move yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You\'re right along, faster, down. Hard to attack</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> trackers. I\'m I\'m here for a good time. Not a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, it\'s hard to, hard to pass up. Good, good food. Yeah. Maybe I\'ll make it back out to the so Southeast sometime and yeah, I miss, I been away long enough from a place to, to start to. Miss or remember things affectionately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh yeah. And I gotta bring you your moon pies. I remember you said yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Little things like that from man. I don\'t miss working outside in the summers there though. I I\'ll come in the winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, do, yeah, we have two weeks of winter now, so you\'ll be completely fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Awesome. Oh, well that\'s gonna warm here too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, I will let you and I. Get through our short week here and oh yeah. Try to pack our bags and, and then, yeah, we\'re gonna sounds like we\'re gonna have a good time. Yeah. We\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> gonna meet up in San Diego. We can\'t have a bad time. I\'m not gonna have a bad time. So you\'re not gonna have a bad time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. All right. That\'s math. . </p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:15:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Defies Marked Increase in Russian Takedown Demands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137723\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-defies-marked-increase-in-russian-takedown-demands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3531:\"<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://transparency.automattic.com/2022/09/07/transparency-report-update-january-june-2022/\">published</a> its bi-annual transparency report this week, which highlights the different information and takedown demands received across the company&#8217;s services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, Automattic has used these reports as an opportunity to publicly reaffirm its commitment to actively pushing back against requests that violate users&#8217; freedom of speech and bring attention to abusive takedown demands.

In the future this may include the company&#8217;s other products like Day One and Pocket Casts, as relevant requests come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent <a href=\"https://transparency.automattic.com/2022/09/07/transparency-report-update-january-june-2022/\">report</a> for the first half of 2022, includes information on the Russian censorship requests WordPress.com received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over the past six months, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have seen a marked increase in the number of takedown demands that target content which is critical of the Russian government and associates,&#8221; WordPress.com Community Guardian Stephen McLeod Blythe said. He cited specific examples relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fundraising for Ukranian aid</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outlining Russian history with a perspective on what led to the war in Ukraine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alleging criminal activity on the part of Russian oligarchs, and their personal connections to Putin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publishing commentary from former Russian soldiers who were critical of the military involvement in Ukraine</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In all of these cases, given our concerns about access to critical information from within Russia, and the implications for freedom of expression, we made the determination that we would&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;geoblock the content at issue,&#8221; Blythe said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also included information on how Automattic resolved IP blocks from two major ISPs in Colombia, after the country blocked Tumblr without disclosing the reason. Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Technologies and Communications had blocked the service after discovering a spam blog on the network. Despite the fact that Automattic had already removed the blog, the process of unblocking Tumblr took months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Situations such as these are not uncommon, and, as the above example demonstrates, the issue of government censorship online or regional platform blocks cannot be reflected solely by the numbers of takedown demands that are received,&#8221; Blythe said. &#8220;As a result, we are committed to continually reviewing and expanding the information that we are able to share in our transparency report.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 21:16:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2022 Kicks Off Today, Free Livestream Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137691\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2022-kicks-off-today-free-livestream-available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2178:\"<p>WordCamp US 2022 is underway in San Diego, California, following last night&#8217;s welcome party for speakers, sponsors, organizers, and volunteers.

Organizers received <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Style+Variation%22\">38 submissions</a> from 19 contributors (some submitted multiple variations) hailing from eight countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the wide range of colors and typography combinations, TT3 is gearing up to be a vehicle for a diverse set of styles from WordPress&#8217; community of designers. Submissions included creative variations for all kinds of design moods &#8211; dark with high contrast, bright yellow with a smaller universal type size, a gradient aubergine background, and many more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic design director Channing Ritter <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/\">published</a> the selections that made the cut to be shipped with Twenty Twenty-Three:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These variations were selected in an effort to feature the most drastically different set of variations possible — so in many ways, we were looking at what would work best as a collection versus selecting our favorite standalone submissions,&#8221; Ritter said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The selections are not in their final form. Contributors will continue iterating on them, under the direction of design team leaders, until the WordPress 6.1 beta period begins on September 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some of the changes suggested may be a bit aspirational, but let’s continue pushing to see how opinionated we can make each of these variations,&#8221; Ritter said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Submissions that were not chosen to ship with TT3 may still have a path towards inclusion via an official child theme of the default theme. Contributors <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/73\">discussed</a> how this might work and have closed the issue in favor of creating a separate project for it after TT3 has launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I particularly like the idea of continuing to create style variations beyond those that are bundled with TT3,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Sarah Norris said. &#8220;I think this is a great opportunity to introduce people to block themes and building variations, with the help of the community and experienced block-themers. It also provides a space to test Gutenberg PRs, in a similar way to how <code>emptytheme</code> is currently used, but with more opinionated settings enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure about this being part of the current TT3 project, and in my opinion, it would be best to start this initiative soon after TT3 has launched.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, contributors plan to refine the selected variations, and the child theme project can proceed without affecting the theme&#8217;s current timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/#comment-26608\">announcement</a> to see each of the selected variations in more detail.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 21:21:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: Anders Norén Releases Björk, a Free WordPress Block Theme for Blogs and Personal Websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-releases-bjork-a-free-wordpress-block-theme-for-blogs-and-personal-websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3853:\"<p>WordPress theme author Anders Norén is at it again with a new&nbsp;minimal block theme for blogs and personal websites.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bjork/\">Björk</a> is the 129th block theme to hit the directory and Norén&#8217;s 25th free WordPress theme. It follows the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/poe-a-bold-new-portfolio-theme-with-30-block-patterns-and-10-style-variations\">release of Poe</a>, a portfolio style theme, less than two months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Norén said he is a fan of the Icelandic singer, his new theme is named for his favorite tree. Björk is the Swedish name for birch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Birch trees are incredibly resilient, which is why you can find them closer to the tree line on the Swedish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fell\">fjäll</a>&nbsp;than any other type of tree,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;They’re also very pretty to look at.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The default style for the theme certainly has a birch-like appearance with its white background and use of <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Albert+Sans\">Albert Sans</a>, a Google font designed by Danish type designer Andreas Rasmussen who was inspired by the type-characteristics of Scandinavian architects and designers in the early 20th century.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop viewers will see a sticky sidebar menu for quick navigation links. This disappears on smaller screen sizes in favor of a hamburger menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Björk has a very classic blog theme structure, with a sidebar navigation to the left and the content to the right,&#8221; Norén said in a post <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/introducing-bjork/\">introducing the new theme</a>. &#8220;You’ve seen hundreds of these WordPress themes before – I’ve released like six of them myself – but with the advent of block themes, everything old is new again. There aren’t a lot of block themes with this structure on the theme directory yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk includes seven different theme styles, in addition to the default, which can instantly change the look of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Norén has also included more than 15 block patterns, which enable users to mix and match and quickly build their own layouts for the front page or other pages. Patterns include designs for featured items with an image, heading, paragraph and button, a testimonials section, multiple hero patterns, call-to-action patterns, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When you install and activate the theme for the first time, you get all of the layouts in place, including the front page. This makes it easy for users to get started by simply replacing the content or rearranging it to suit their unique needs. <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/bjork/\">Check out the demo</a> to see approximately how it will look once installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk was built using Norén&#8217;s Davis Blocks theme as a foundation, the same framework used to build Poe, his last release. It&#8217;s a small package, with just 500 lines of CSS and no JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bjork/\">download for free on WordPress.org</a> or via the &#8220;Add New&#8221; themes screen in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Site Editor has really come a long way in a short amount of time,&#8221;  Norén said. &#8220;The most noticeable difference is that I’m having a lot more fun building block themes now compared to when I released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/tove-wordpress-theme/\">Tove</a>, my first block theme, a year ago.

The company outlined additional steps for sites that have been compromised. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All BackupBuddy users are advised to update to the patched version 8.7.5. iThemes made it available to all users, regardless of their current BackupBuddy licensing status, due to the severity of the vulnerability.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 19:42:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.1 Walkthrough, Dropping 3.7 – 4.0 Security Updates, WordPress Advanced Administration Handbook\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=121526\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-1-walkthrough-dropping-3-7-4-0-security-updates-wordpress-advanced-administration-handbook/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13814:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-september-5-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (September 5, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Get ready for WordPress 6.1!

To give some context for how old these versions are, in 2013, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-7-released-wordpress-now-updates-itself\">WordPress 3.7 introduced automatic background updates</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released\">3.8 updated the admin</a> with a new design <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/\">based on the MP6 plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; official policy is that the security team only provides support for the most recent version, but as a courtesy has extended backporting security fixes to older versions that are able to receive automatic updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until now, these courtesy backports have included all versions of WordPress supporting automatic updates,&#8221; 10up-sponsored Security Team member Peter Wilson said. &#8220;Versions WordPress 3.7 – 4.0 have reached levels of usage, namely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">less than 1% of total installs</a>, where the benefit of providing these updates is outweighed by the effort involved.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than half of all WordPress sites are on the latest version &#8211; 6.0+ (54.3%), and security updates will still be available to more than 99% of sites on older versions after this change. Wilson said the decision to drop support for 3.7 through 4.0 was based off the information reported on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">statistics</a> page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress version stats</a> &#8211; 9/7/2022\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The effect of this imbalance means that the Security team spends most of the time preparing backports for the vast minority of WordPress installations,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;By dropping support for these older versions, the newer versions of WordPress will become more secure as more time can be focused on their needs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next three months, versions 4.0 and older will receive their final updates and will also display a non-dismissible notice in the dashboard, advising users to upgrade to the latest version as their sites will no longer receive security updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 16:37:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WordPress.org blog: Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1323:\"<p>As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These versions of WordPress were first released eight or more years ago so the vast majority of WordPress installations run a more recent version of WordPress.

The PR he referenced (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41740\">#41740</a>) is an extension of those explorations that takes the mode even further towards the objective of removing visual clutter when the focus is on editing text content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until now the preference, when toggled on, would only hide some of the toolbar icons and a few other non-essential UI items,&#8221; Draganescu said. &#8220;With this PR the preference will have a more drastic effect, turning the UI into a blank page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the previous explorations were more focused on&nbsp;removing UI from the canvas, the demo video above shows how Draganescu&#8217;s PR takes it even further to create a full-page writing-focused environment. This iteration does the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>hides the top toolbar, makes it appear on hover over its normal occupied<br />area</li>\n\n\n\n<li>removes many top toolbar buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>automatically closes any open sidebars</li>\n\n\n\n<li>hides the insertion point indicator</li>\n\n\n\n<li>hides the block toolbar</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu to turn on this mode would be added to the three-dot drop-down menu under the other alternative modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Draganescu said there are a few outstanding bugs and the UI copy is still under consideration (distraction free, toggle interface), but he said he thinks it will be &#8220;a great complement to the incoming &#8216;zoomed out mode.\'&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella created an experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41156\">PR for the zoom-out view</a> idea for the site editor, where the focus is on site building and composing patterns, allowing users to move sections around without affecting inner blocks. It makes it easier to build templates without worrying about block editing. Draganescu said if this code lands, it may lend some foundation to the distraction free mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature has generally received positive feedback, with a few minor suggestions to correct issues with dismissing the screen and the autosave message. The team does not seem to be in a rush to land distraction free mode in Gutenberg but significant progress has been made over the past six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With distractions increasing in the the digital world, some of the most reliable and efficient interfaces are those committed to staying distraction free.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Sep 2022 12:01:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #72 Gutenberg 13.9, 14.01, WordPress 6.02, Themes and Design Tools\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=22015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-72-gutenberg-14-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49122:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and Nick Diego discuss highlights from Gutenberg 13.9, 14.01, WordPress 6.02, Themes and Design Tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nick Diego</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>developer advocate at WP Engine, plugin developer and themes builder.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13.9, Gutenberg 14.01, WordPress 6.02, and a lot of things about themes and design tools in the editor. And I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress Developer Advocate. And today, I have a special guest on the show, it&#8217;s Nick Diego, Developer Advocate at WP Engine, Plugin Developer, and Themes Builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just learned he is also from the hospitality industry. So, we have a whole new show. He&#8217;s also a Core Contributor on WordPress and running triage sessions every Tuesday in the core editor channel. And he&#8217;s also a teammate of mine on the 6.1 release squad. Good afternoon, Nick. Thank you so much for coming to the show today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, sure. I should probably also mention that you were part of the group of experts on the developer hours meet up, where a group of contributors answer questions from the audience. We should schedule some more, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> We should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, in the meantime, until that happens, you held or will hold also build up basics events on the learn WordPress online meetup, thank you for those. Most events were recorded and are uploaded to WordPress TV. So, you get a lot of Nick Diego on WordPress TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, what have you learned that&#8230; what are the most common concepts that are harder to understand for people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> Well, first of all, those online workshops are so important for engaging directly with the community and WordPress builders. A lot of people aren&#8217;t keeping up with what&#8217;s happening in Gutenberg, they have businesses to run, websites to build, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress is developing so quickly as we&#8217;ll see in today&#8217;s episode with all the things that have happened in the latest releases. And so, it&#8217;s a great time to connect with them and just to cover the basics. One of my main series is builder basics, where we talk about really the fundamentals, like how to work with row blocks and group blocks and that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think people really get a lot out of that. And so, I&#8217;m also really excited for the new 2023 theme because it&#8217;s going to incorporate a lot of the new functionality that we&#8217;re seeing in WordPress and provide users a place to look and see a working functional example of all the new stuff that&#8217;s coming in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a couple ways. There are online workshops and all the other developer relations stuff that we&#8217;re doing, hopefully, we can help get people up to speed more quickly than they would on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, if you don&#8217;t have them signed up for the meetup yet, where you get all the announcements of all the new workshops that are coming there. Sometimes, there are months with 2025 workshops. Well, month of August wasn&#8217;t so good because we were&#8230; many of the faculty were on vacation, but definitely sign up and join the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, there are 20. Sometimes, there are 60 in there, I have noticed. And most of them are recorded. So, even if you&#8217;ve missed them&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to watch the recording when there is some life interaction with people in there. So, Nick, you mentioned the 2023 theme and the update here is that the theme is a base theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was a call for the community to send in style variations, that&#8217;s style variations, or something like a skin of a theme that follows the theme, but you can change color, fonts, and other things, spacings, and all the good things. And the community submitted actually 33 style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next week, the team will learn&#8230; the team will decide which ones are bundled with the default theme. And I look through them, I like quite a few. So, did you get a look at them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I did. I did. And some of my fellow colleagues submitted a couple. It&#8217;s a really exciting project, reach out into the community and get designs from other community members, it really makes you feel like this is a community project and WordPress is open-source and we have a big community. I really like the direction they took with this and the designs that have come out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there are all voices in the community that you don&#8217;t need, every year new theme, just add new styling there or so not every WordPress is going to change a theme every year, so. But you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s actually the reference theme for all the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if the listeners want to learn more about style variations and how to create them and what it was working on one of them for the 2023 theme, Justin Tadlock, takes you along in his new post on his experience designing the style variations on the Gutenberg Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I love this sentiment, although there are 1,400 words in there, but I&#8217;m just picking those from Justin&#8217;s post. So, there was a&#8230; and I quote them. “So, there was a small part of me that remembered exactly why I fell in love with WordPress in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like that same 21-year old kid who had just learned to edit a theme style CSS file to make some minor color changes. This was the WordPress that I remembered from so long. The one where themes were not hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code.” So, back to the basics and back to just do change the styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s such a great quote from Justin and I completely agree. I think that because with block themes and this movement that we&#8217;re on, it&#8217;s really making themes a lot more accessible, it&#8217;s brand new, so it&#8217;s something new that you need to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is creating simpler themes that can be visually unique with just a few lines of code. And I think that provides a lot of power to users, especially in the low code, no code movement, I think there&#8217;s a lot of exciting things happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s back to the thinkers that can just change some things and have immediate gratification that they see it right away. There is no build spot on. There is no PHP thing or, yeah. So, it&#8217;s good. Well, WordCamp US is coming up next week. I am so excited to go to San Diego on Wednesday night. I can hardly wait. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ll be there Thursday, but yeah. No, this is actually my first WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I was planning to go the 2022 one, but then the world fell apart. So, yeah, I&#8217;m very excited to be going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Well, awesome. Yeah. So, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m going to see you there. So, I knew that you would be there, but I didn&#8217;t know that was your first WordCamp, so yeah. Go through that post on, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s what WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe what to do when it&#8217;s your first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I saw that, yeah. I saw that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s so spot on. Yeah. So, don&#8217;t worry dear listeners, if you didn&#8217;t get a ticket, there will be live streams of the talks and workshops, and they will all be recorded and available on records to be sometime later this year. So, there are quite a few block editor-related talks on the schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Alex Ball will talk about customizing core blocks for clients. Very interesting topic. I have lots of discussions about that topic. Evan Mullins has a talk titled FSE for the win, it&#8217;s a lightning talk. And Daisy Olsen&#8217;s workshop on Saturday morning is about creating your first block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Tabor, always a great presenter, will talk about the new era of WordPress themes is here, block themes. And I saw you on the roster of a lightning talk. What will it be about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, the title of my talk is a little, I guess, attention grabbing it&#8217;s build a custom block in 15 minutes. So, the goal of this presentation is to demystify the complexities of block development in WordPress. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve heard a lot. Oh, building block is really challenging. It requires new skills, whether it&#8217;s JavaScript or React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea behind this is to show that you can actually build something quite functional in a short amount of time. And hopefully, inspire the&#8230; either that you&#8217;re watching it through the live stream or you&#8217;re attending, inspire people to build their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I&#8217;d be the first person to say that building blocks can be challenging depending on the complexity of your project, but it&#8217;s never been easier to get started with block development. We&#8217;ll actually talk about it later today. But there have been so many tools built by the WordPress community that makes getting started with block development easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you combine that with some of the internal block supports, some block controls that are available directly from WordPress. And you can really get started pretty quickly in less than 15 minutes as I will demonstrate. So, very excited to be giving the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;m probably going to sneak in there. I&#8217;m going to be in the accessibility testing workshop, but I will sneak out and come see your talk. I hope that everyone&#8217;s punctual there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Hopefully, I can do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We know afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But what are the other talks that you are interested in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So, I&#8217;m really interested in&#8230; well, I’m very excited to see Rich&#8217;s talk. And as you mentioned, Rich is a great presenter. But I&#8217;m excited to learn more about things I don&#8217;t know much about. So, there&#8217;s getting started with WP-CLI, CLI. And then, there&#8217;s another one by WordPress Through the Terminal by Milana Cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t know much about them. And I think it&#8217;d be a great opportunity to learn more. It’s one of the areas of WordPress that I should be better at, so I&#8217;m excited to learn from those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. Both are great presenters. So, if you&#8217;re in San Diego, the listeners, and we cross path, please don&#8217;t be shy. Introduce yourself. And I want to meet you. And even if I&#8217;m in a conversation with others at WordCamps, we try to follow the PacMan rule, I don&#8217;t know. Do you know about that, Nick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I learned of it, but I did not know prior to seeing the description here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, when we stand in a group of people and you always do, you have two people, then another one came said, &#8220;Hey, glad to see you.&#8221; And then, you talk about things, you chat together. We don&#8217;t make close circles. We always leave one opening so other people can walk in and join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s an explicit permission to join a new group of people. And that&#8217;s how you meet people. That&#8217;s how the community works. So, definitely welcome to do this, and I will always make sure there is a spot for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, we are on the section of community contributions. And Ryan Welcher did a Twitch stream this week about the new features of the create-block package. And I have actually the YouTube link for you and the show notes because he just finished uploading it to YouTube. Twitch only saves the video for 14 days and that&#8217;s&#8230; so, Ryan always downloads them and uploads them to YouTube, he edits them sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he was exploring the new release of the WordPress create-block package. And he thinks it&#8217;s a game changer. I think so, too. So, he goes over the new features, the flags for the, speaking of CLI, the flags of the terminal program for no plugin and variant flags that have been added to the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These flags increase the usability because they allow the users to add a new block to an existing plugin and or theme, and also provide the ability for a template to provide different variants for a block, like either a dynamic block or a static version, for instance. So, it&#8217;s going to be a really cool if you, yeah, do you want to say something about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, a little bit of sneak peek. So, the create-block package is absolutely fantastic. I will actually be using the create-block package during my presentation, that&#8217;s what makes it possible to build a block in 15 minutes. So, there&#8217;s really no way to get started with block development. And Ryan&#8217;s did a fantastic job both working on the package itself, and then also educating folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He actually runs an online workshop through the meetup, through the training team as well talking about building custom block. So, can&#8217;t say enough good things about Ryan and the work he&#8217;s done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. No, I feel the same way. If you are more the reading type learner, Ryan also updated documentation pages for the create-block package. And we have the link in the show note, and there&#8217;s also an added section to it for how to create templates for the tool, your custom templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you can use them for agency specific scaffolding and standardize some of the work there as well. Okay, got that done. Speaking of themes and I have the feeling there will be more talk about themes or, yeah. Anne McCarthy gathered about 15 theme developers from the community from the FSE program, FSE, Full Site Editing Outreach Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they discussed various aspects of theme development with Full Site Editing and starts also Figma and design systems was a topic, and how they can work together with the theme JSON. Figma also has a theme, a JSON file operation, then custom block development, or how to organize pattern libraries in her post and concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I quote, &#8220;While there is both excitement and interest in what block themes unlock.&#8221; It&#8217;s also clear that there is a buildup of pain points to address whether through clearer resources or changes to good look itself. Now, besides that conclusion is, if you are a theme developer hearing from people who already worked with block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some of them are no strangers to our listeners, it&#8217;s Ellen Bauer, Carolina Nymark, Rich Tabor, Ana Zagora, Herb Miller. It&#8217;ll jump your discovery or speed up your knowledge. So, I really urge you to just listen into people talking about the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress 6.0.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So, now, let&#8217;s move on to the releases. First up is the WordPress 6.0 release. It&#8217;s a security maintenance release with a few bug fixers for the block editor. And it was released, I forgot, it was, I think, August 30th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Something like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But there was one thing in there that you worked mainly on it, that&#8217;s allow remote pattern registration in theme JSON when code patterns are disabled. So, what was that about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I&#8217;ll give you props for originally flagging this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s where a lot of times, theme developers want to disable the core patterns that come with WordPress. You&#8217;re building your theme and you want to provide your own patterns, which makes perfect sense. And there&#8217;s an easy flag to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But unfortunately, when you would do that, you would basically turn off your ability to pull down patterns from the pattern directory. So, it stymied the growth of the pattern directory, because theme developers couldn&#8217;t both use their own patterns, shut down the core patterns and then pull down from the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, this little, fairly simple change allows that to happen. So, now, you could include your pattern with your own theme, and you could also pick and choose from the pattern directory and include those with your theme. Little simple change but I think an important one for people to actually use the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because now, if you wanted to, you could put all your patterns on the pattern directory and then just create a custom theme and then pull them down from the pattern directory into your theme. So, it really opens the doors to a lot of different ways you might want to work with patterns and themes, which I think is exciting. So, glad to see this push through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really glad that made it. But when I thought about, not when I thought about it, I got it from other theme developers who said, okay. So, I was thinking how could we curate the block directory without having a lot of additional changes in Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that change was really good. And now, you can curate, even if you are not a theme developer, but you are working for an agency and your developers have a theme for you and you want to add some of the patterns from the directory you want because of fun or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just add the theme, edit the theme, JSON file and add disabled core patterns, but also edit the same JSON file to pull up. I don&#8217;t know, four or five patterns that you like or from your favorite designer. So, it&#8217;s really cool. But of course having 200 or whatever, how many patterns are in there now? I think it&#8217;s 18?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s one of the things that turns people off in the pattern directory is you open up the&#8230; you&#8217;re just getting everything. And this way, it allows you to really pick and choose what you want to include, which I think is what most people are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, that is already available. If you have updated your WordPress instance to 6.0.2, and there were others, the link in show notes will have the changelog from the make blog, so you can look what are the fixes, where in there, it was a security and maintenance release fix release. So, there are no new features. And this is actually not a new feature it&#8217;s just a-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: A bug. I considered it a bug, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.9 and 14.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. So, the last time we had a changelog recording, it was for Gutenberg 13.8. Now, today, we discussed 13.9 and 14. And there were a few enhancements in 13.9. For instance, the media and text blog got a new help for the image settings control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s a little bit clearer what it actually does. The post author block now renders HTML in the editor for the author description that is&#8230; there is this user profile section in the WP admin. And when you write the description for a user that&#8217;s pulled in into a theme, you can actually add HTML to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; I didn&#8217;t read it yet. So, that&#8217;s definitely an enhancement or going back to original feature set. The post feature image now has a link target and attributes. Not quite sure. I&#8217;m fail to see the, oh, you can&#8230; link target is you can open up a new window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly, a new tab. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And I also like that query title in the search template or the search result template. Now, you get some variations there. That is really cool. And then, is the transforms. Transforms is such a powerful tool. But I don&#8217;t think a whole lot of people, developers or plug-in developers or theme viewers are actually using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you can unwrap the group. It&#8217;s actually only a change in or an add-on to the transform menu that you actually can do this&#8230; the box that are assembled into a group can now be separated again. It&#8217;s the same as the more options menu, but it&#8217;s much faster to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And transforms, it&#8217;s actually a huge topic. And later this year, we&#8217;re probably going to talk a lot more about it because there&#8217;s some work in progress. Do you want to take the layout style?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. So, we are breezing by many, many enhancements because we would be here all day if we were talking about each one. But under global styles, you can now add a disabled layout style, theme support flag to opt out of all layout styles, which it just provides developers with more flexibility about how they want styles to be applied. And then, the next one which I&#8217;m really excited about, and I think it&#8217;s so minor. And I&#8217;m excited because this is my ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I saw that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: But it enabled opacity on global styles for color pickers. So, if you&#8217;re in the normal block editor, when you add a color you can actually change the opacity on that color. They&#8217;re nobody&#8217;s no fault of anybody just got left off in global styles, so that got added. So, adding consistency. So, now, you can basically change opacity on colors throughout the all of WordPress, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Good job. Thank you, Nick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I think that Ellen Bauer pinged me about that and I&#8217;m like, I can fix that one. That one&#8217;s easy. I can do that. And then, for elements, update the load order of CSS in the site editor. We have a lot going on in the editor with different style sheets and different way things are loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with time, we&#8217;re starting to see these&#8230; figuring out the optimal way to load styles and making sure that nothing&#8230; things don&#8217;t interact negatively with one another. So, a nice enhancement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also about the hierarchy, now who comes first. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Exactly. It can get very tricky because we have, what we have the theme, we have core, we have user styles that they edit in global styles. So, there&#8217;s a lot going on in the site editor for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then, we have edited stuff from the theme and it&#8217;s really&#8230; I&#8217;m glad that someone is actually organizing that. So, it&#8217;s not too complicated anymore. The site editor also got up some changes or some enhancements. Well, so, the author nicename template creation is now available for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that concludes with the fallback template for content, all template possibilities that you could create with a site editor, author nicename, it&#8217;s not the username, it&#8217;s a different field in the profile, but you can now do it with that instead of the author name, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, that all the templates are there, we also finally got the view side link in the editor. And I think a lot of millions of people probably are so glad that is actually now available. You don&#8217;t have…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I would hear it so much. I would hear it so much. Where&#8217;s the view site button? And now we have it, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we have it. And I think it needs to be more intelligent. So, because when I edit the single page or single post or template, I want to click view site and then see it, but it goes to the homepage. But it&#8217;s one step at a time and I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to open browsers and do all that, which reminds me so much of previous of WordPress scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. No, it&#8217;s definitely a huge improvement, but more work to be done, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Like Everything in WordPress, you have a first version and then you see what do the people want? What do we do? Let&#8217;s try it first and see what we need. So, I think that&#8230; is that all for 13.9 that we want to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of bug fixes, just a lot of improvements. But I think the meat of new features comes in 14.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think there was a lot as of the 13.9 was really a cleanup things and that continued. There were also in the background, some changes continued from lodash and from the testing that were continued from, and I think the last three or four plugin releases actually. And I&#8217;m right? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the end of 13.9. In comes Gutenberg 14. And it was just released this week on August 31st. And it came with an enhancement. I would like to change that a little bit up. Let&#8217;s start with the design tools first, because that&#8217;s what everybody&#8217;s waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. This is I&#8217;m so excited about. So, to focus on the example of a paragraph block, one of the things that was missing from the paragraph block was the ability to change the font family and the typography controls. We had all the other stuff but not font family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you couldn&#8217;t change margin and padding. Now, there&#8217;s good reasons why those, that functionality wasn&#8217;t in Gutenberg yet. There were still some things that needed to be fixed and whether it&#8217;s visualization for margin and padding or interactions with web bonds to do those font family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we finally cut the green light on all this stuff. And there&#8217;s a huge project underway to provide consistency across as many blocks as possible. So, in 14.0, you&#8217;ll now see, for example, font family across not all we&#8217;re not quite done yet, but most blocks. So, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s that muscle memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you learn how to change font family on one block, and then you go to the next one, you expect that to be there, right? And so, this huge process of standardizing design tools across blocks to me is super exciting. I hear from it all the time from users, why can&#8217;t I do this here? But I can&#8217;t do it here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And huge effort was made in 14.0. And it&#8217;s continuing. And we&#8217;ll be continuing to 14.1. We got tons of typography support, tons of spacing, padding and margin support. And we also got a lot of color supports as well that were missing. So, there&#8217;s a lot there and I encourage you to check out 14.0, because there may have been something you were desperately wanting and it most likely will be in 14.0, if not, 14.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And well, think about how many blocks are there. They&#8217;ll need to be updated. So, that&#8217;s a huge effort for contributors. I&#8217;m not sure, I haven&#8217;t looked at the copays yet, but some blocks do it differently than other blocks in the background. So, it&#8217;s always a&#8230; you can&#8217;t just copy paste like you would do it in a Google doc. You definitely have to think about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: There&#8217;s no magic switch you can just turn on then, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Now, you with theme JSON when every block has it. But up until now, that wasn&#8217;t possible yet. And now, that the controls are there, you also have them in the theme JSON file, so for your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And that&#8217;s a really good point, because I&#8217;m sure there are some people listening when I&#8217;m saying, look at all this new functionality, they might be like, I don&#8217;t want my users to have that. You can always turn this stuff off in theme JSON. So, before you&#8230; even if you wanted it, you couldn&#8217;t have it, now you can have it. But if you don&#8217;t want it can be turned off, so that&#8217;s an important component for those that want to turn off stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s WordPress. If you have new features, we need the code to switch it off. It&#8217;s definitely MO4. It&#8217;s a standard for WordPress, right? All right. So, we mentioned it also before in 13.9, no, with Ryan Welcher&#8217;s Twitch stream, the create-block has a new variant flag as well as a no plugin flag that is in the enhancement section of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to point out a few other things from the block library. One is a setting to hide the prefix for the archive title. I don&#8217;t know how many people come to me for the classic theme to remove the category string from the archive page or the archive title. And now, with block theme, it wasn&#8217;t possible. So, now, it is. It has come in and it was actually a blocker for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s really funny. This is actually a really interesting issue because the archive title is just it&#8230; the block is just a wrapper around the PHP function that&#8217;s been in WordPress forever. And so, there are people who&#8217;ve been building WordPress forever like, oh, I know how to do that, there&#8217;s just the filter to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then, you have the people that are coming at WordPress in a no code situation and they need the control for that in the block editor. So, it&#8217;s a really interesting like little microcosm of the two worlds coming together and it&#8217;s like you can change it in the filter with PHP, if you know how to do that. Or now, we have the ability to turn off the prefix, which I think is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it enhances WordPress because you&#8230; a user, whenever, you would do this before. Now, they are. So, I&#8217;m really excited about that. Even if you know how to develop, yeah, just making a check mark in an interface is so much easier than, yeah. And open up your development environment, make that change, upload to the server and then, yeah, all…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Google how to do it because you forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then, now, the post-date block on the query block or the post template. Now, you can also select that the date is the last modified date instead of the published date, which is actually also an enhancement that wasn&#8217;t before in WordPress. And so, you always have the latest date of the modification for the post, if all, or page in your Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, we come to the next big feature, which is the list block has a version two, and it&#8217;s now out of experiments and available in the plugin out of the box. And give it for the next three weeks, a big testing because it will come to retro 6.1, we hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear, but because it&#8217;s coming rather late in there. But it&#8217;s out of experiments. The list items can now be easily better sorted with a much more improved user experience. Did you get a chance to use it yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, yeah. And one of the things that always frustrated me, the original list block, because I kept like, I&#8217;d want to change the order of my list items, and you could. And not that I should have expected that, but you&#8217;re so used to moving blocks around. I&#8217;m like, why can&#8217;t I move this list item? Well, now you can. And it works great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. So, it&#8217;s the little things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It is, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It adds up. And also, in 14.0, we have a few global style changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I can talk about these. So, I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of block gap. And block gap is something that, not everything is making use of, but it&#8217;s the gap between blocks. And those that use it, it&#8217;s an incredibly powerful tool. And one of the things that&#8217;s neat now is the introduction of axial gap support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one of the things that you have is if you imagine columns or buttons that are in a row. Before when you set block gap, it was the gap between the blocks, what happens on mobile when those blocks are displayed vertically. And well, now, you can control both the horizontal gap as well as the vertical gap, which is really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I hear a lot about or had heard a lot about was the lack of responsive controls within WordPress. And we&#8217;re starting to see how we&#8217;re not getting some interface where you define what you want on mobile and define what you want on tablet. But we&#8217;re getting these more holistic approaches to dealing with different devices and axial gap is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, really great to see. And then, another one, which is, I think honestly, a game changer when it comes to where we&#8217;re going in WordPress is what are called spacing presets. So, if you were changing margin or even block gap or padding, you&#8217;d get a little slider or you could type in a pixel number or you&#8230; it&#8217;s free form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users, that&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s also hard for anybody. Because if you want to have consistent padding or spacing throughout your site and you keep having to enter in a specific number or use a slider, you get, did I add five pixels over here? Did I add 10 over here? I get lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, spacing stuff simplifies that UI where you can define how many steps of padding or margin, how many steps of space so you could have small, medium, large, extra, large, whatever you want. And by enabling this, WordPress provides a set scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in theme at JSON, you can define your own scale. So, I&#8217;ve been playing around with the defining my own scale and it&#8217;s great, and not to go too deep into this, but I&#8217;m very happy. When you define your own scale, you can also define a scale that uses fluid spacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not only can you define small, medium, large, you can make that spacing value using clamp fluid. So, you can have small on desktop as different from small on mobile. And all of a sudden, you have a very fluid website that&#8217;s adapting based on old devices and it&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to take some retooling in how people build themes a little bit that really take advantage of this stuff, but it makes block themes super powerful. And we&#8217;re actually going to start seeing that in the 2023 theme. So, that&#8217;s why back to our original discussion why 2023 is such an important thing, important theme, is this going to provide a real world example of how to use some of this stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that combined with the fluid typography, it has been in the plugin for quite a bit now, but it&#8217;s coming to 6.1. Definitely, it&#8217;s really getting better together for the mobile responsiveness and all that. I had a conversation with plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they had, I think, six view port changes that you can make to the block. And I was thinking, okay, who would actually want that? Who has the patience and the perseverance to change layout for six different view ports? And-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: For every block, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For every block, yeah. So, as you said, the scaling of this is a little bit different. So, on the last item for the global styles we&#8217;re going to talk about is the pseudo element supports for button elements. That is the hub and other pseudo elements for the buttons that you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Focus and active. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Focus and active, yeah. Thank you for helping me out. And we had this already for the link element. And now, we also have it for the button element, and it&#8217;s both in the interface as well as available for theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> Yeah. Having these additional supports for elements is really great. And it allows you to pull a lot of that CSS that you had in your own style sheet and put it back into the theme JSON. Granted theme JSON, they&#8217;re getting quite big. But the beauty is you can edit it directly in the global style. So, it&#8217;s very powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Awesome. So, good things are coming to WordPress with the next version. I&#8217;m just going through that. And we have some more features, one more feature with&#8230; for the patterns, this new bundle of collections of header and footer block patterns in the plugin, because the directory is not working right with all the dynamic stuff. So, they bundled a few more collections there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s nice to see those updated. The ones that have been there have been in there for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. I think the pattern when, the first introduced like the 5.5 or something like that. So, they&#8217;re coming&#8230; new things are coming in the pattern. There&#8217;s one feature that I really like, it&#8217;s the merging of blocks that you allow, that you can merge wrap blocks or into wrap blocks from both and list group and all that. It&#8217;s a nice quality of life change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it needs a little bit, it takes more to explain that than show that. So, we probably need to do a demo on that and will be demoed on any of the talks that are on workers, learning on workers, not learning WordPress online, meetup groups. I&#8217;m sure some of them will demo that. And that, I think unless we overlooked something, we are at the end of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Well, I mean, for the listeners, we breeze through a lot here. These two releases 5.9 and 14.0 super impactful, but they&#8217;re also give you a really good look about what&#8217;s coming in 6.1. We&#8217;ve had full site editing and block themes in WordPress for a while now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been hesitant to jump in 6.1 is going to have a lot of things that you might have been looking for in order to get started and jump in. So, very excited for 6.1, and having all of this stuff included in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the next version is 14.1. Of course, the next&#8230; and it will be released on September 14. That&#8217;s interesting because on September 13, it&#8217;s going to be the walkthrough. That&#8217;s a preliminary date. It hasn&#8217;t been officially announced, but it&#8217;s for you listeners here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard it here first. But it&#8217;s when the release leads from a core, technically leads from core and block editor go through what&#8217;s going to be released and demo some of the things. So, we have all the priorities, right? The last version that will make it into WordPress 6.1 of the good note plugin is probably&#8230; so the feature releases on September 20th, there will be a release candidate of WordPress 14.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whatever gets into that release in that milestone will be wrapped up and pushed into WordPress 6.0. And I think the editor release leads will do some last. And of course, the triage will go through that and see what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I have a lot to do with the next few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All of us, because we are going through all the PRs and mark all for dev notes. So, there is a team. And Milana is doing the same for core, for the track tickets to find the dev notes that need to be published, and then we publish them. So, that&#8217;s going to be a really interesting thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I learn so much when I do that. It&#8217;s just mine. I don&#8217;t know where my brain do, it does that. But yeah, I just keep adding to it. So, we are almost at the end of the show. Is there anything, Nick, that you wanted to share with our listeners that you didn&#8217;t get to yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ll do a short plug here. So, our developer relations team at WP Engine, we do a lot of contributing to both the docs team and training and to core. But we also do, produce our own content, take supplement, some of the things that are already out in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, if you just go to wpengine.com/builders, it&#8217;s all just tutorials and articles on building with modern WordPress, very topical to what we&#8217;ve talked about today, talking about fluid typography. One of my favorite articles that I just released is about contextual patterns, which I don&#8217;t think that many people know about or use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a great way of functionality that&#8217;s in Gutenberg and in WordPress to take your theme to the next level. So, yeah, lots of great content. But of course, we&#8217;re always contributing to training docs as well, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I really like what you&#8217;re doing there. All of the articles are really well go deep, sometimes, deep developer wise, sometimes, content creator wise. So, it&#8217;s a great mixture for any target audience pretty much. That&#8217;s terrific. So, thank you for joining me today, sharing your knowledge and opinions with our listeners. And I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting you in-person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I know. Yeah. I can&#8217;t wait. Well, thank you very much for having me.

You made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what I thought. When Doc Pop invited me to the Pope Magazine.

Dear listeners, our next show will be recorded on September 15th. So, there&#8217;s 13, walkthrough, 14 release, 15th Gutenberg changelog recording. It will be released shortly after. And we will have the brilliant Channing Ritter from the WordPress design team on the show. As always the show notes will be published on gutenburgtimes.com/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is episode 72.

This is a fun little feature that was tucked into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">Gutenberg 13.9</a> changelog last month with very little fanfare:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Rich text: Add character shortcuts for wrapping selection. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">42469</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shortcut is a rich text feature contributed by Automattic-sponsored WordPress core committer Ella van Durpe. It works in a similar way that <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31571\">pasting a link over selection</a> will auto-link the text instead of replace it, a feature that landed seven years ago which she also worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new quotes shortcut escaped my notice until I saw George Mamadashvili&#8217;s quick video demo on Twitter: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My new favorite Block Editor shortcut is the ability to wrap selected text in quotes. Select text and press `, \' or \". <br /><br />This nifty little feature shipped with Gutenberg 13.9. However, the editor always supported air quotes. <a href=\"https://t.co/VnPqv6E44U\">pic.twitter.com/VnPqv6E44U</a></p>&mdash; George Mamadashvili (@Mamaduka) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mamaduka/status/1565761697989726209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 2, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a clever feature that is commonly supported by IDE&#8217;s like IntelliJ and PyCharm. Although wrapping with quotes is likely the most common use case for this type of shortcut, it also supports wrapping the selection with a back tick (<code>`</code>), which will automatically wrap it in a code tag instead of replacing the selection with a back tick. van Durpe demonstrated this in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">PR</a> with a gif:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you frequently copy and paste text that is meant to be in quotes, or code that needs backticks, this new shortcut is a major timesaver and one of the most exciting features to land in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">13.9</a>. van Durpe said it was generalized to work with any characters, such as pressing <code>(</code> to wrap the selection in parenthesis, instead of deleting the selection. However, this was scaled back a bit during the review before the PR was merged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit worried with expanding these to characters that are natural openers because I suspect it&#8217;s a typical action to select a word and type the first letter of what should replace it — parentheses and quotation marks, in particular, would have a much higher incidence of cases where the intention is indeed to replace the selected text with the mark, not to wrap it in them,&#8221; Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura concluded that it&#8217;s worth testing but suggested more characters be added incrementally to focus feature announcements on the ones they are more certain about &#8220;without the ones that could be problematic tainting the feature.&#8221; This is possibly the reason it wasn&#8217;t highlighted in the release post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backtick and quote characters are the only two included in this iteration of the feature. It&#8217;s not easy for users to discover in the natural course of using the editor, so it might need a little promotion for people to start using it enough to know if it&#8217;s going to become one of those indispensable features or something that is inadvertently causing frustration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Sep 2022 03:29:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Performance Team Takes Over WP Super Cache Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-performance-team-takes-over-wp-super-cache-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4657:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a>, one of the oldest and most widely used static caching plugins for WordPress, is changing hands. After 15 years, the plugin&#8217;s author, <a href=\"https://odd.blog/\">Donncha Ó Caoimh</a>, is handing over maintenance and development to Jetpack&#8217;s performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been building WordPress sites since the early days, you are almost guaranteed to have used WP Super Cache on at least one project (or hundreds). It is based on an earlier plugin called WP Cache 2 that Ó Caoimh <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2007/11/05/wordpress-super-cache-01/\">forked in 2007</a> when its author had lost interest and was no longer developing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack&#8217;s performance team manages the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a>&nbsp;plugin, used by more than 100,000 sites, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/design/content-delivery-network/\">CDN</a>. In today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/wp-super-cache-joins-the-jetpack-family/\">announcement</a>, Jetpack assured current users that they will still be able to &#8220;enjoy its core features without a new plugin or a connection to Jetpack.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re excited to start working on WP Super Cache,” Jetpack Performance Lead Mark George said. “Our goal is to create an experience where anyone can make their site extremely fast without being an expert. We want to help make sure that WP Super Cache remains a reliable and easy option for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change in hands is not an acquisition. Ó Caoimh, who was the very first Automattic employee, confirmed the company did not buy the plugin from him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked in Automattic since the company was founded, so they&#8217;ve supported the development of the plugin all along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Really, the plugin is moving sideways in the company, from one developer to a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t have time to work on it properly. I&#8217;m working on other projects, mainly <a href=\"https://crowdsignal.com/\">Crowdsignal</a> now, and it was hard to find time to work on it. Jetpack will be able to do a lot more with it than I ever could.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ó Caoimh said the support burden for the plugin isn&#8217;t that bad, despite it being active on more than two million WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The plugin has a &#8216;debug log&#8217; that will log (almost) everything it does to a file, which makes it easier to figure out why a problem is happening a lot of the time,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn&#8217;t able to give the support forums the time it deserved either. Now, a team in Automattic will be helping answer questions and solve problems. It can only be a good thing for users of the plugin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ó Caoimh said handing over maintenance and development to the Jetpack team frees up time for his family and eliminates a source of stress, as he was worried that WP Super Cache wasn&#8217;t getting the attention it needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the past I worked on this late into the night but I have a family, and they come first,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jetpack team already has plans to modernize the plugin and will be investing more resources in support and new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While we research new features to help make WordPress sites cache faster, we will begin updating the WP Super Cache UI to bring it in line with modern standards, so it is easier to use,&#8221; Jetpack VP of Marketing Rob Pugh said. &#8220;In addition, we’ll be working behind the scenes to ensure it’s compatible with our other performance features like Jetpack Boost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 15 years, it&#8217;s impressive that WP Super Cache has maintained a 4.3 out of&nbsp;5&nbsp;stars rating on WordPress.org with 1,296&nbsp;reviews. With the Jetpack team&#8217;s resources, support in the forums is likely to improve, and users can expect to see more improvements as the plugin now has a team of people moving it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have no regrets handing over the plugin to Jetpack,&#8221; Ó Caoimh said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to create and maintain a plugin that might be used by a handful of sites, but this plugin is used by two million sites. If I introduced a subtle error that impacted people using WordPress in a manner I hadn&#8217;t thought of that might cause problems for thousands of websites. The itch that I scratched by creating WP Super Cache has well and truly been scratched and has long healed.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 20:46:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 67) — What Does Professionalism Mean in WordPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=114431\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/what-does-professionalism-mean-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56786:\"<div class=\"wp-container-15 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Dan and Eric discuss their top picks for WordPress news stories of the week and the topic of professionalism.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Not bad. Um, yeah, another, another week coming, coming down to, uh, to a close and assembling the, the stories that matter. We want to, um, get into our often jampacked newsletter and thinking about, um, weird camp coming up. And, um, I think everyone\'s getting geared up for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, So what\'s, what\'s on the top of your mind this week, I wanted to kinda run through the top three, um, news stories of, um, the commentary issues, questions in the WordPress space that, uh, matter to you. And I\'ve gotta got a few, two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think the biggest thing that came out to me is that, uh, the whole WebP support in, uh, WordPress six point ones kind of being reconsidered at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thought that was, uh, a lot of community pushback on, uh, how they were going to implement it and kind of nice to see the, uh, leadership, uh, in, you know, the developers take a step back and kind of think things through again,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. Yeah, that\'s gone back and forth quite a bit. I, I got a little lost, um, keeping up and like, like you and your earlier writing about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think a lot of us feel, boy that would turning that on by default, um, is, is not something we like is there should be. An option or at least, uh, I don\'t know. I could see, I could see putting in a default for new installs or something like that, but for, to suddenly switch, um, potentially, um, everyone over from JPEGs or, or whatever, that\'s, isn\'t that the main sticking point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, basically it would take, um, what was being proposed was that if you uploaded a, a JPEG or a PNG file or whatever, uh, WordPress would automatically convert it to a WebP and use. And so there\'s, you know, talk about, well, that takes up a lot of server resources. Um, WebP isn\'t supported in every browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s like specific versions of safari that are a few years old that don\'t, you know, uh, support it yet. And just all the files that it\'s gonna create, cuz you know, WordPress creates three or four versions of every image you upload. And if it\'s doing that again for WebP versions, You know, some folks on cheaper hosting accounts could run outta space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And then there\'s the whole idea of, you know, WordPress is all about controlling your content and controlling your process. And to me, that\'s kind of a, the oddity of it. It\'s like, well, they\'re gonna force you to use this format that by the way Google created and you know, yeah. Not everybody wants to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think, you know, having a check box makes a lot of sense, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s, uh, I was looking at, um, working on, um, towards editing on the, uh, web Almanac, um, which a number of WordPress people contribute to each year for, um, CMS section of that. And, um, their data set where they compile, um, run a bunch of queries on a test population and, you know, see how many are using WordPress and Elementor stands out to, and, you know, WordPress is just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing the numbers are, are way out there. And you start to think about, um, the dramatic impact it, it would have with, um, Switching a format to, you know, suddenly becoming very heavily used, like, um, like WebP, which, which I\'ve kind of been in favor of, uh, from a sustainability perspective, because end performance it\'s, it\'s generally faster and is gonna use less bandwidth and let\'s storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you duplicate, you still have all those old JPEGs and you duplicate that. And yeah, you\'re really adding a lot in that, in that respect, it\'s not saving, uh, saving the planets and. Particularly well, um, but I haven\'t seen that side of the discussion come up, um, on it, but I, I, uh, I know there are people who care about, um, just how much we\'ve got in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just junk and it\'s taken cost in electrons, power every day. Um, so it, it will be interesting to see how that gets, that gets sorted out. Um, I\'m sure more efficient formats are where we\'re headed. um, so my, my, um, my number one pick is, is not really something that\'s been tackled yet. I\'m sure people are starting to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t, uh, I have to let things settle and think about a bit, but there\'s a, there\'s a big running discussion that started in two channels, two threads and, and, uh, post data is slack. Piracy G or unethical behavior with cloning, um, you know, G GPL clubs that get hold of a commercial license and crack, uh, WordPress plugins and, and so on, and then re resell this, uh, cheaply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s always been a thing. Uh, I think I remember that going on in ju. Um, there\'s we all know the reasons why that\'s a bad idea, hurts people\'s businesses. There\'s often malware that comes along as a payload with your free, cheap cracked software. Um, but this, at the same time, one of the big culprits here, um, was adding in some, adding in some new product that is sort of specialized at a niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s not, you know, it\'s not, uh, Cheap plugins are some quite high end things targeted at hosts. Um, so it\'s a, it can be really devastating to some people\'s business model. If, if it were, um, if it was costing them, their target audience, some people feel actually, you shouldn\'t worry about this because the only people using it or kids or people who aren\'t your customers anyway, um, but this one particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting, uh, pirated, uh, GPL club. Where\'s archives, spammed, a ton of people, including people who are in the middle of this discussion. Uh, just at that moment, um, got a lot of Twitter, DMS and, and other things, uh, straight at people who totally don\'t want is going on. So, um, Allie Niman suggested, well, you know, one way we could come combat, this is go at the host and say, there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spamming. Um, there\'s been some discussion of what could we do collectively to fight back and protect the ecosystem. Um, have you taken a look at those discussions or seen this come up in the past and have thoughts on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. There have been a number of cases over the years where people\'s plugins have been forked and stolen and, you know, resold that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I, I wonder how many of those plugins are actually in product. Especially on high level sites. I mean, if you are a web designer who is, you know, partaking in something like that, uh, you know, clients may have these things on their sites and not know it. I wouldn\'t think there\'s a huge number, but yeah, I think Allie\'s, uh, you know, Suggestion of going after hosting is, is, is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think maybe it could go after payment gateways too. I know, like, especially PayPal has been rough on anyone. Who\'s doing anything sketchy over the years. You know, if, if that\'s gets reported, they may get their, uh, their payment gateway shut down, which, you know, could kind of cripple their ability to redistribute this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I mean, I do think WordPress leadership should speak out on it. You know, I, I know that\'s, I mean, it\'s not just a WordPress issue. It\'s, it\'s a software issue. It\'s an open source issue, but you know, just some sort of statement, you know, maybe even at word camp us about, you know, let\'s protect this ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s make sure. You know, everybody\'s playing by the rules and that we, you know, if we find someone who\'s not, we should, you know, make, uh, everyone aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I\'ve I\'ve often thought, man, I wish there was some advocacy. I wish we had like a nonprofit or, or some collective where we supported, uh, advocacy for open source to both educate people who know nothing about it, the consumers and everyone else and just show, Hey, look, this is a professional space where people are making, living from small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers solo people. Who\'ve been at it a long time, basically family businesses, all the way up to, um, in the bigger, the bigger companies that are heavily by everyone else. It\'s a, it\'s a big family and, uh, they\'re real people here. And if you, you support these products, it\'s, uh, it\'s hurting us. So there\'s kind of that, um, The, uh, tending the collective governments, governance of an industry as a commons like this, an open source one there\'s, there should be things that, um, outside of the project, even that, that people in, in the WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can do that would kind of be on the list of Eleanor Ostrom\'s, um, things that healthy ecosystems, healthy commons do to, uh, to protect themselves where you, you find the bad actors and find ways to suppress and discourage that. And sometimes if they\'re internal to the community, you wanna, you know, not completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demonize them, but give some kind of carrots and stick so that there\'s incentives to come back and be a good contributor. And you know, some host, straight anger, rage on the internet is just adding to useless stressful stuff. Maybe there\'s a win in this and on the advocacy and education side. But, uh, I also threw out the idea that since the WordPress foundation does legal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense of the WordPress trademark. Uh, this is like one step away. Suppose you had good citizens who are doing five for the future. Um, and they\'re, they don\'t have quite the means to individually defend themselves in the same way or they\'re are there ways we could, um, pull together and help each other through, um, through that, through the foundation or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Um, yeah, you would think there, there could at least be some sort. Guide to, uh, steps you can take, you know, I know they, they have lawyers working on their side, as you said, to protect trademarks and, and things like that. You know, even if it\'s just general advice to come out and say, Hey, your, your, your, your plugin has been selling on the black market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what you can do. Here\'s some resources that would, you know, seem like at least the basic way to, to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I think it\'s kind of a black eye for. Uh, for any, any business ecosystem, uh, people looking to get into it. Um, it may not understand quite what\'s going on, but it looks if it looks like you\'re laying down to predators, um, who have gotten entrenched it\'s it\'s not a good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign for the healthiness of the ecosystem. And it, it would, um, definitely be good for morale to have some, some clear boundaries defined and say like, this is not okay in our, in our world. And we\'re not gonna support this anyway and find what we can do to limit it. Um, over, I wrote about this a few weeks ago, because FIUs had on their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pretty long post about dealing with this. Um, and we\'ve, we\'ve done this before people getting courseware stolen. It can be content that can be all kinds of things getting ripped off. Um, When you, you may or may not have any intellectual property rights over it. If it\'s, if it\'s GP stuff, um, some is some isn\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but they, they actually had some interesting, uh, case studies or, or people who, who didn\'t fly off the handle, they would get, ultimately you\'re getting support requests from people who have. This pirate did stuff. And sometimes they don\'t know, um, what they\'ve done or what situation they\'re in. And someone had found that it was kind of a teachable moment where they could educate and, and convert some of these people into customers and say like, oh, okay, we\'re not gonna give you support until you\'re actually our customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people just needed that. They just needed the education, I guess. So, um, there\'s maybe there is some win possible there. Um, All right. Well, what\'s your, uh, what\'s your next pick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Okay. Well, I have to go with the, uh, little scandal about, uh, WP optimize and the alleged cheating on, uh, performance tests by, uh, turning off all JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and when it\'s, uh, under a, a testing user agent, I guess it\'s, it\'s able to detect that. Say okay. It\'s GT metrics or it\'s, uh, page feed insights. And in that case, we\'re gonna turn off all of our, all of your site\'s JavaScript to boost your score and make you feel good about yourself, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. So that got quickly compared to the Volkswagen scandal a few years back, and there may have been another manufacturer car manufacturer doing that when you hook the cars up to a, uh, Uh, emissions test, um, they, uh, turn the catalytic converter and filters on and rest of the time, uh, it, it\'s not on and you get, um, better performance on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I don\'t, if it yeah, probably affects fuel economy. Right. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah, I think it was, I want to, I think it does. And then it also, I mean, the pollutants that came out of those cars on the road,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Way more than the legal limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really bad. And so they had, it was a huge blow for the, um, for the brand, uh, a huge amount of distrust, uh, and, and a blow for what everyone, you know, probably was a really solid brand Volkswagen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the. The interesting. I, I remember I, this was a, when I was teaching writing last, um, there was a Corey doctoral piece about this. Well, it brought it in as an example, and he was talking about we\'re dangerously going into a. A future where software can be so sophisticated, we don\'t really know what it\'s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t even really know if the experience we\'re having is software mediated with an there\'s an algorithm that is manipulating the semi virtual experience we\'re having. So is your, is your WordPress really? You know, what\'s it doing? Uh, who\'s it talking to, um, Are you, are you, when you think you\'re doing tests, are you getting valid, um, results?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, the trust issue is, is interesting. Um, how, how has the response been from, um, from the company that has allegedly this, this code in it that is sort of a cheater code on, um, op optimization tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. So Sarah Gooding at the WP Tavern put. Article together that, uh, spoke with, uh, one of the lead developers of WP optimize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, according to him, it was a code that was forked over from another plugin. And I have to plea ignorance on the name of that plugin right now. But, uh, apparently they were in talks to maybe, um, acquire this plugin. And at the time they decided to, um, kind of merge some code in there to make it, um, You know, to get ready for this big merger they were gonna have, which ended up falling through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, um, it ended up that they forgot the code was in there. The deal fell through. And, um, they weren\'t quite sure why the code was still in there or, you know, kind of pleaded ignorance on it. Um, but then Sarah also came up with a, an article the day after that, uh, kind of dug into it more where I guess, you know, this, the, um, the, the settings in this plugin are also a little bit up too, so they\'re not, uh, completely clear on what they\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you know, there\'s, it, it, it may be not an intentional thing, but at the same time, it still doesn\'t look very good. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it will be interesting to see how quickly and how well that that clears up. Um, yeah, I really care about the trust, the trust issues, and you know, again, kind of like the, the piracy, if, if you, if there\'s a widespread perception of, we can\'t trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain brands or theoretically any hypothetically anyone in the, in our ecosystem. It it\'s a, that\'s a really bad consequence where so much trust is at, at the core of making open source work. But in a sense, it\'s open source working. Someone looked at the code</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah. It\'s interesting that somebody was able to test that and found that what it was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, I don\'t know. I I\'m, I\'m not a huge believer in these metrics. Um, you know, they, I don\'t wanna say they\'re made up, but they\'re, they are kind of made up and they don\'t always reflect, I don\'t think, you know, the actual user experience. Right. But, you know, I think any of these systems we bring out, somebody\'s gonna find a way to cheat on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you wanna cheat on your performance test and get yourself, you know, a little bit of an ego boost by saying, oh, I scored a 99. You. And so be it, um, you, you are the one that kind of has to live with it, but I think the plugin should, at the very least be very clear about what they\'re doing and you know, what it\'s used for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\'s good about it. And, you know, here\'s how you shouldn\'t use it. Um, which, you know, they apparently did not do in this case. Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it, it does pose again to me, like interesting questions about what could we do better as a community collectively to incentivize good behavior around performance. Can there be kind of a general working standard or guidance on for plugin authors and for users?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what we\'re looking for? What makes afor, what, what\'s the margin of, of a good performance plugin or just. I wish if you had details, when you\'re down, you you\'re in the.org repo, how many queries does has add to your page? What kind of, what are the main dependencies here? Um, is there a quick way to get a heads up on that sometimes, um, before you in install something and then find out , um, all, all of, um, all of the work being done in performance core is, is really outstanding and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it\'s probably wrong to think about it as this is just a core, that\'s their problem. And this is a, a core thing. There\'s, there\'s a huge plug in ecosystem where, uh, testing and standards could be, um, a bit more rigorous and that it sort of came up a bit with a proposal from, um, uh, Felix aren\'t to, um, um, look at to when, when plugins are submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, To, uh, test specifically around performance and security, a little bit more rigorously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> And yeah, I mean, we have, I mean, you know, where I live, we have, uh, energy star appliances, right. That means that they\'re certified as being efficient. You know, maybe there\'s a third party out there that can do that for plugins, or I don\'t know if the word price folks would wanna do that necessarily, but, you know, we have, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could have like some sort of, uh, certification system that says, Hey, this plug. You know, performs well and is lean and is secure. Yeah, of course that, you know, it\'s hard with software because there\'s no guarantees. Um, of course your refrigerator could break the day after you bring it home. But you know, things interesting to thank see if somebody would ever, uh, come up with something like that, that you know, and how legitimate it could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah, that could be really useful. Um, maybe if it was a consensus or amongst hosts who, you know, doing anything at scale, the, the, the performance, um, matters in dollars in significant dollars. Um, and yeah, we should think more about that. Um, my, my next pick was, um, Gravity acquires gravity. Um, the, uh, uh, gravity forms, um, uh, acquire G gravity flow and, uh, and the services, um, oriented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what was it name,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> name, uh, gravity experts. I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, gravity experts. Okay. Um, not too familiar with those, but these are, uh, product and, and services in the gravity forms ecosystem that, um, we\'re are owned and were owned and developed by, um, one of, uh, gravity\'s team members. Um, so that\'s, that\'s kind of an interesting story is I don\'t, I\'m not aware of anyone, anyone else building an E plug in ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around their product and working that closely where your employees are, are developed. Uh, I would assume, uh, encouraged to develop a product or service related to it on their own, and then maybe it really takes off and bring it back in into the, um, parent company. Um, Is that, is that something unusual they\'ve innovated with it\'s you\'re not being taken over by a big, uh, a conglomerate it\'s it\'s the family you\'re already</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I kind of think that\'s interesting. Isn\'t it? I mean, you do a side project based on your everyday job and then your boss essentially buys your product. It\'s like getting a really good bonus at work. You don\'t don\'t really get that. So I, I, I kind of think it\'s cool though. Um, you know, gravity forms, if you use it a lot, I mean, you notice there are tons of, you know, official extensions and they have a whole third party directory now and they go through and certify certain add-ons, uh, third party add-ons on their site that you can look through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, kind of a neat thing. I mean like gravity flow. Um, allows you to really do some complex things with, um, what happens when a form gets submitted. You can tie it in with a bunch of third party services or have it do different things on your site. So I think that just is such a natural fit for gravity forms that, you know, why wouldn\'t they wanna sell something that does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Um, and then gravity experts is a service. That\'ll do a lot of customization and. As I mentioned to you off the air, I think that, you know, they probably get a lot of customization requests through their support. Sure. Um, and I\'ve actually just from my own experience, found their support to be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They tend to, I mean, they don\'t mind sending you code snippets to use for, to achieve certain things. Um, this steps it up a whole other level. Um, you know, if you need customization services, well, we have that too. Um, you know, why not keep that all in house and you. And maybe some of the customizations they create could end up being products on their own too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it would be a great way to kind of continue to grow their</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> business. Yeah. It\'s a really, it\'s a really cool thing. And I, I wonder if anyone else is, is doing that. It, it, it occurs to me. The advantage of it is, is that, um, your own in internal people know that product best, but there\'s not really, if they\'re already working for you there, there\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you budget and, and allocate like, Hey, go and develop, you know, blue sky, even, you know, go and build, uh, add-ons for this. Um, and, and see what we come back with. It\'s a totally different thing. Um, the incentives are, are not there as if you\'re, you\'re building this as your own product and in if it\'s good enough, um, it\'s you, you gotta get it to the point of maturity and, and quality where a competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Might actually want it or someone else might. And, um, then I guess you\'re, you\'re really establishing value in a, um, a clear and somewhat more neutral way while still totally being within this, um, sub economy, this E gravity ecosystem. It\'s a smart, smart way to own and share it collectively and not smother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity and things like that. And yeah, I just don\'t, there\'s no other way to, um, to do something like that in the usual, usual way where some outside company would absorb something else. And then maybe the quality, you know, there\'s just stereotype or fear the quality\'s gonna drop off cuz it\'s a different,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually we worry, even plugins get acquired, but not in this case because it\'s, you know, the OG has it now, so we don\'t have to worry about, you know, them. You know, making it less quality or, or not supporting it? Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, it\'s a fantastic model. I think others should seriously take note. There\'s plenty of, um, plenty of other ecosystem plugins that, uh, have this potential for that kind of collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, good one. Okay. So yeah. What\'s your, what\'s your third?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Pick. So my third one is that, uh, wordpress.com this week announce that they\'re gonna start offering $499 websites to anyone who wants one it\'s, uh, supposed, supposed to be done within four business days. Uh, they\'ll give you a choice of themes or they\'ll pick one for you, which is kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you pick my theme. Um, I, I, I kind of wonder. Who the target is and what the strategy is here. Are they just trying to get you in the door? So that you\'re kind of part of their wordpress.com ecosystem you kind of, uh, a different, uh, different strategy? I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s, uh, it\'s interesting. I did write about this, um, because it was, I, I love it when, you know, we have, we have about a 10 year, um, backlog, uh, Back issues and, you know, things that have, uh, we can look back and see the history on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I thought it was a further back, but it was just probably about a year ago that, um, wordpress.com did that for the first time where they introduced a premium, um, built with wordpress.com service, which this seems to be an add-on to that the, uh, part of. Same brand, but the, the initial one a year ago was, um, not supposed to compete with freelancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was priced at around $5,000, um, as a baseline that seems to have come down in their FAQ. Now it\'s, it\'s around three. So there\'s still this, this premium layer. And I think that was supposed to use, um, Agencies and people within the ecosystem to do some of this work. I\'m not, we really haven\'t got, I don\'t think anyone has dug into that or gotten numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were very curious to, to see what, um, what might come out of that in, in terms of its success for wordpress.com and who\'s how many sites are being brought into it. What that it\'s, we\'re, we\'re very data poor. About the economics and details of the market. And that also made me think too, in this, in this story, that, um, is it, is that really competing or over the same piece of the pie or is there, is there so much there it\'s not, um, not a, not a threat to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so freelancers, small agencies, the way they, they might think, um, you can do very different things and I can see why.com wants to, you know, continually expand at, um, where it\'s easier to do that, where it\'s always had more market share at the lower end of, of the market. Uh, but when you\'re freelance, those, those are not necessarily the jobs you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> So I, I actually made a joke online that I would rather like farm up stuff I don\'t want to do to them because at that price point I\'m, you know, probably gonna lose money. So yeah, if they wanna take on that, that small stuff, that\'s, that\'s cool with me, but right. Um, it is kind of interesting to, to think that they\'re going after that, that market too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. Right, but I think you\'re right about, about them not wanting about a lot of people on the lower end, going to wordpress.com to start out because it is kind of managed</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> for them. Right. And as they pivot more and more to presenting themselves as, as a managed WordPress host, um, with. With that market in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, there, there are others already doing, doing this. Why, why let competitors have a, a free run at this? Um, they\'re doing the same thing, but.com now I\'ll Hey, you can, uh, you can install pretty much anything in the repo. I, I think, and there\'s a commercial ecosystem within there. You can buy Yost and everything else right from within there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as it grows, it\'s not, you know, it\'s not. The way to look at that is still ecosystem growth with opportunities for, um, plugins and services and other things like that. But, um, I also feel like we looked so much at the market share number and where it\'s biggest is the, um, top 10 million plus active sites with WordPress installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, it\'s the bigger universe. And you assume that these are. People\'s personal blogs and so on. But, um, because they\'re not, it\'s just by traffic, you know, they\'re not in the top 10,000, but, um, when I did a lot more freelancing, a lot of the clients I had that were good would be established. Nonprofits, local governmental things, um, people with, with significant budgets, but they\'re their traffic is they don\'t care about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, that much necessarily. Um, they\'re not doing even doing much content marketing. Maybe they have a newsletter. They\'re speaking to a very. Specific audience that may be numbered in the hundreds or the thousands. They\'re doing a lot on social. So they would be considered in this low end of the market, but that\'s, um, but by assessing their site by traffic, but it\'s not a that\'s completely a misnomer, then they would have no, no use for a, um, A hired site builder, even they need, they need an agency or, or someone with a capacity to do support in the hosting and a rather much more elaborate feature set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that market, that market is always there. I, I, I think people forget that and you\'re not gonna be killed off by the $500, four day service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> No. And, and I mean, if they they\'ve talked about, you know, wanting to compete with some of these proprietary systems like Wix, And I think that\'s kind of the same market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, people that want to not spend a ton of money and maybe in this case, they don\'t even really wanna build it themselves. They just want something up there and maybe as they grow, they go to something bigger. But to start out, you know, it\'s not a huge investment and. You know, those are the folks that I think aren\'t necessarily attracted to freelancers, not just cuz of budget, but because you know, somebody wants to try a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somebody wants to start their small business and with no guarantee of how long that\'s going to last, you know, is that client going to still be there for you in two years? And if they are, you know, what\'s the value. Are you getting so many support requests that you can\'t necessarily deal with? So in that way, I, I, I don\'t think this is a bad thing to kind of tie them all into that, that one service, uh, it might, it might be, you know, something more beneficial for them that where they can even leave at any time they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, the business goes belly up, you know, it\'s, it\'s not as tangled and messy as it might be getting away from an agency or a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I\'m, I much rather have them on, um, on.com or anything in the WordPress ecosystem than WX. Um, which I still, man, I have a, I was in, I\'ve had to use it again recently for a, a local nonprofit I\'m, uh, helping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I, I don\'t like, I don\'t like Wix . Um, and I\'m just thinking like, if, as this organization grows and what\'s needs, are it, it needs open source. It needs WordPress. It needs data security. Um, there. There are things that maybe they\'re not in a position to pay for, but they\'re at this point, but their success will get them into that at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and there as a, um, running your own business, that\'s a kind of, you can only do that. You know, you, you can ask those questions and do the discovery and form the relationship and say, look, these are, these are the needs you really have. And, um, what\'s. What\'s really the best product or, or thing here. And sometimes that leads to long good relationships with, uh, a decent paying client who may get a lot bigger, um, in that budget at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. All right. Well that, that all kind of ties in kind of nicely, um, to the last thing, um, kind of our topic we wanna open up for kind of long term discussion and get. People engaged with, um, kind of a big central one for, for post status. And, and I think everyone working in this space is, is professionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what does it mean to be a WordPress professional? We say we\'re the post status is the community for WordPress professionals. And that\'s an interesting phrase that\'s really kind of come into, I would say, in the last five to 10 years, um, widespread use in our community. And what does that, what does that mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, As an individual as a, and within the community and the, the business ecosystem, uh, to be a WordPress professional and professionalism in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, WordPress professionals kind of interesting, cuz it started out as a small blogging platform, right. And people were using it as more of a hobbyist thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of a sudden, you know, the theme and plugin markets kind of exploded and we. Using it as a full blown CMS and, you know, for all sorts of projects from, you know, the, the little tiny startups to enterprise. So I think the professionalism part of it is, you know, that there\'s a lot of traditional parts to professionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I, I think being polite and honest and, you know, hardworking and all those things come to come to mind, but then, um, it also meets kind of. The WordPress way. That\'s a little bit more relaxed. I think that kind of reflects, I think that reflects on Matt Mullenweg a little bit. He\'s not always, you know, the, uh, old fashioned stuff, shirt, CEO that mm-hmm , you know, gets up there and makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, grand pronouncements necessarily. Um, but it also, I think, reflects on, you know, the word camp culture of just kind of going come as you are. Um, but generally, you know, being kind to one another being open, uh, to discussion doesn\'t always work out that way. But, um, yeah, I think it\'s, it\'s an interesting way to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress these days. I mean, cuz a lot of us make a living with it. Um, either full time or at least part of the time and you know, the ground rules that applied for other sorts of businesses over the years don\'t necessarily, you know, apply here. Uh, it\'s a little bit different kind of ecosystem I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it definitely is. I, I think people hear that. That word and there\'s sort of the, you know, the larger corporate stereotype of, um, well, there\'s, there\'s good thing. There\'s good. Basic definitions of, you know, you show up every day, you do the, you do the work every day, no matter what, um, the basics of it, but there\'s also the, um, the kind of the negative, um, connotations of professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, In, in a more corporate scaled up space, that\'s kind of lost the human and individual element, the personal element, and doesn\'t have this kind of big family community of relations necessarily. And I, I mentioned to you a, a friend, um, Sarah Shelman. Who\'s got a book. I think that touches this. She runs a, they do a lot with WordPress, but it\'s a, it\'s a social design agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re they\'re anthropologists and ethnographers who try to solve, um, Largely institutional social problems and municipal governments and lend advice on, um, dealing with things like homelessness and, and, uh, why do helping institutions often they\'re too bloodless and faceless and impersonal to help very real individual human problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, I got to know, I got to know her. And there are people last year. I\'ll probably do it again. We\'re working with, um, kind of post COVID recovery projects or city is, um, funding. Uh, we just listened to people\'s stories and got them to talk about wellbeing and what that means for them. And, uh, it\'s, it\'s a very unusual kind of, wooy even kind of, hippie-ish, uh, weird thing that you don\'t usually associate with government, um, bureaucracies doing something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals listening to each other and caring something about the experience and totality of each other\'s lives. Um, you know, that might be good for good for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> We use more of</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that. Absolutely. Yeah. And she, we were talking about professionalism specifically after this and she said, Yes. The, the dysfunctional form of that, that we try to overcome is, is the sense that you\'ve got to create a mask of invulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there\'s coinciding and even integral to word breast professionalism, WordPress professionals, and professionalism is that you can be known as a person who has. A full life and all these other things going on. And, uh, we talk about that and there\'s, there\'s not as much of this kind of informal or private segregation from the business side, especially, maybe on, you know, on those who\'ve been in it a long time or contributors and, uh, small businesses and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s a, really, a really healthy thing for people. And it translates to a healthy community and I think a healthy. Business ecosystem, um, because it takes the edge off of straight hard competition, the tendency for towards paranoia and reaction and meanness, uh, especially on remote and internet stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I feel like that\'s a, a big part of it. And when we, uh, Michelle Frette featured, um, ran, uh, or featured, uh, member spotlight for. The week and, um, well known to many, many people, Jonathan Boer. Um, who\'s now at automatic as, um, working on training, which is a kind of newer and big thing there, um, impacting the, the community and doing code instruction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and he said some really good things that, um, I think define. Him and others as a, a good model of, of what professionalism is. And he, you know, there\'s power to change lives and people finding, um, their footing in the community and in work here. And, um, what else was, was, was in here. It was just a very, there were very personal flavor to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'re not doing kind of faceless, um, Roles and cubicles here. A lot of people really value that freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, you can see it as you know, we\'re not afraid to let our human side show, which I think is like really refreshing. I mean, if you look at a lot of the more traditional corporations out there, I mean, when do you see their leadership out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like just being humans. Um, and of course it\'s at a much greater scale, but, um, Just just even, even with, uh, Corey Miller, um, you know, talking about the struggles that he\'s had and, you know, I mean, he\'s a very successful person and you know, he, he and, uh, his family have done a lot in WordPress, but you know, he\'s still ha not afraid to show some vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s so important. I mean, did you don\'t feel like you have to put up a facade? Um, you know, that\'s one thing I\'ve. Kind of felt comfortable with in the, in this, uh, community, is that if I\'m having a bad day, I can say that on Twitter and, you know, still being thankful for what I have. I could still say, it\'s not been a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t done well. You know? Um, not every industry really accepts that and would, you know, applaud that. But I think ours generally does. And I think that\'s something we should not take for grant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I, I, I really, uh, value that too. And, and agree with that. I think that, um, Jonathan and you, and I have probably been around this around the same period of time going back 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re in the generation X category, um, where, um, yeah, we might have slack or tendencies, but I, I think it was still, it was still younger people and, and down to my kids\' ages, who. Really more comfortable with, um, not separating who they are in their private lives and you get messy, even, you know, politics and, and feelings about a variety of things that we don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you don\'t have to pretend that doesn\'t exist. It\'s it\'s a really, it can be a really fine line. You don\'t there\'s there\'s oversharing. There\'s there\'s stuff it has to balance out, but yeah, somehow. When we\'re healthy, uh, as a community advantages to work out. And Jonathan mentioned, um, post status is being a place that serves that by, um, not just you can go there for answers and social kind of hanging out and, um, Fun things and, and, and, uh, there\'s always plenty of good humor, but there\'s, he also mentioned having bigger philosophical discussions around business, open source and everything, WordPress related in a respectful and inclusive way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, yeah, there\'s not, there\'s no way to define, there\'s no recipe for that, but we know it when, when we see it and that have being able to. Maintain a level of trust that comes from being real people to each other who care to know something and share things about each other. Um, and you know, the role that word camps play in that meetups for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mentoring becoming more of a thing, um, that we talk about and, and support. Um, it, it allows the hard stuff, the bad feelings, conflicts competition. In theory, and I think we\'ve seen this happen. people can work, work it out. It takes the edge off of that and becomes, um, a way where I don\'t know, pressure valve a yeah, it, it definitely performs, um, a, a healthy service to, um, a way to check in and, and maybe help each other maintain a, a healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and, and business culture, um, that is, that is professional in our own, our own way. Um, and all the, all the normal ways you\'d think about showing up, getting stuff done, being reliable and, um, the best you can every day, but also showing up as a, as a real person who values, trust and kindness and respect, um, between each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the more of that, more of that, the better, but . Do you have any other, uh, thoughts on, um, on that topic or where we, where that could go, uh, hoping to pull more people into to discuss it? Um, since it seems, seems like one of those kind of pressures, commodities that, you know, it\'s actually not an economic thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\'t, you can\'t buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> No, and it\'s, I think it it\'s good for your, for your own health, for the health of the community. And you know, when you can see others, whether you agree with them or not as, as a person, as opposed to, you know, sub distant object that you\'re, um, at odds with, or you want to, um, or you\'re competing against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it does take that edge off a little bit. It lets you just kind of take a deep breath and you know, I mean, we see arguments just like in any other community, but what I don\'t see is them becoming to the point where, um, at least in public where, you know, it it\'s just incredibly toxic. Um, and usually if things do go bad, there\'s always somebody else to come in and say, Hey, wait a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s, you know, take a deep breath, which. It\'s just, I think refreshing, I, I, I wish, and I won\'t go into it too far, but I wish we had, uh, you know, political leadership that could do the same thing we had, like, like, you know, a referee that could come in and voluntarily say, Hey, you guys don\'t agree, but that\'s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> tough. Yeah. And it\'s there, it\'s an ideal, we\'ll never be perfect at. Um, and. Yeah, to take one example, I\'m thinking about writing about, you know, one of the, um, a, a friend in, uh, uh, a country where democracy has been threatened and on the way and along a while. Um, and that\'s very widespread. We\'re all, we\'re seeing a lot of, uh, difficult times for some of the, the, the key values in the project, in the community and the, in our own lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and actually was. I think jailed and suppressed for things. He was blogging of a political nature on his WordPress blog in his, in his country. And, um, which you can imagine doesn\'t a number on you, um, psychologically and, and socially. And then of course, like anyone else, especially your plugin or theme author, or something like that, you run into what feels like unfairness at some point in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the, um, in your work life, in the ecosystem of, um, how decisions get made, how, how things are handled. And, um, I, I feel for people sometimes when we\'re not at our best, or even when things are, are perfectly fine, it\'s not, everything is not gonna go your way all the time and it can feel oppressive or like people are not living up to, uh, levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transparency or kindness as, as they should. And I try to think, yeah, you know, there\'s people coming from a lot of different contexts where, um, you wanna be sensitive to all that, but there\'s also, there\'s also a need to kind of bear up with, we\'re not always at our best. We\'re not, everything is not consistent the way we think it should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. That means try harder. Don\'t give up on it. Um, keep it\'s it\'s it\'s hard for a reason. It\'s not, uh, not something you can just take for granted. Um, yeah, and I wish there was more of it well said. Well, I look forward to, uh, clicking, publish on, on the piece you\'ve written for us that touches some of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of some of these things too, in the writing space that we both occupy and, um, the value that being able to write and talk well and respectfully and in an informed way, um, about things going on and in WordPress is really important. And I thankful for your steady part in it. I\'ve, you know, read you for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, I think the first time we\'ve connected face to face and, um, yeah, I\'m glad. You\'re here and that you\'re there. doing what you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Thank you. Thank you. It\'s been, uh, it\'s been awesome being here with you and, and, you know, I\'ve been a post status member for several years now and, you know, I\'ve just gotten so much out of it, just the connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just as you said, the philosophical discussions that go on and it it\'s, you know, it, it\'s a little bit of everything and I, I think it, it\'s a great representation of the community and as a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, well, it\'s the, it\'s the members membership who makes it it\'s the community that shows up and, and, uh, that we keep carrying each other along and, and bringing in new people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s it\'s great.

This has allowed the platform to amass a well-designed and solid body of work. However, we needed to mix things up a bit, to make theme development exciting again. The next default theme, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a>, will be a stripped-down base theme with a pool of style variations built by our design community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the community has not disappointed. By the deadline of August 31, theme authors had submitted over 33 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Style+Variation%22\">variations for consideration</a>. This was a reasonably significant turnout, considering that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">project&#8217;s kick-off</a> was less than a month before. That is not much time to create and execute a design, and some people shared multiple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final group of variations that will ship with Twenty Twenty-Three is set to be chosen by September 7. Not all will become an &#8220;official&#8221; variation. However, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/73\">discussion that proposes</a> a separate child theme that would offer even more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the oldest theme authors in the WordPress community, I was excited about this effort. There was no way that I could pass on the challenge of designing a custom variation. Plus, it fit in line with some of the current work I was doing in finding pain points around FSE for theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I will share my experience with <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-json/#global-styles-variations\">building a custom style variation</a> for Twenty Twenty-Three. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Style Variations?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are one of my favorite features of modern WordPress, second only to block patterns. They allow theme authors to ship multiple design presets that users can choose between via the Styles panel in the site editor, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Example style variations for Twenty Twenty-Three.\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations can be as simple as a couple of color or font changes to entirely unique designs in their own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Before Beginning: The Right Mindset</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing to keep in mind when designing a custom style variation is that you are not building a theme. You are skinning an existing theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to get carried away with grand ideas about what is possible but only become disappointed with the limitations of the global settings and styles framework. You can change things like typography, colors, and spacing, but there are times when you&#8217;re stuck with chosen presets when they are used within templates. You also cannot arrange layout elements to your liking. That would require, at least, a child theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are skins with a specific set of rules that you must follow. You do not quite have the full power of CSS at your disposal, but you can do some pretty nifty things under the current standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a custom style variation is an easy introduction to modern theme development. It is a way to get your feet wet, to gain an understanding of how <code>theme.json</code> works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing a variation for Twenty Twenty-Three was also like trying to hit a moving target at times. Because the theme was under active development during this process, it meant that anything could change on any given day. And, the more complex a style variation was, the more likely a change to the base theme would affect it. This should not be the case for established themes, but it did create additional hurdles to clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stepping into the Fray: Building a Custom *.json File</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />JSON file for a custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are one of the easiest onramps to WordPress theme development because creators only need to work from within one file. The usual complexities around theme development are of no concern for such a project. And, because the global settings and styles feature has a standard ruleset, it&#8217;s easy to make a few changes and see quick results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations are <code>*.json</code> files that live in a theme&#8217;s <code>/styles</code> folder. In the case of Twenty Twenty-Three, the organizational structure might look something like the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs\">/twentytwentythree\n    /styles\n        /example-a.json\n        /example-b.json \n        /...\n    /theme.json\n    ...</code></div></pre>\n\n\n<p>Because my variation was named &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/86\">Rough Draft</a>,&#8221; it was located at <code>/styles/rough-draft.json</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom variations follow all the same rules as the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living/\"><code>theme.json</code> standard</a>. The one exception is that variations have a <code>title</code> field to differentiate them from the theme&#8217;s default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is an example of what my variation&#8217;s JSON file looked like:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"title\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Rough Draft\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {},\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"styles\"</span>: {}\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-6\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>With the basics out of the way, the variation can overwrite anything that is defined in the theme&#8217;s primary <code>theme.json</code> file. A creator can do something as simple as overwrite the <code>settings.color.palette</code> to create a new color scheme. Or, they can configure every possible setting and style under the standard ruleset, building a massively different work of art from the base theme design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Good: Wow, This Is Really Cool!</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view of custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>I have dabbled a bit here and there with custom style variations. I have long understood their potential, but I had yet to dive into a full-blown project, particularly one that could land in front of millions of users. I don&#8217;t know that my variation submission will be a part of the curated set, but it was just plain ol&#8217; fun tinkering with a design idea again. It was also far less stressful to not have to worry about every aspect of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the time constraint, I pulled my initial idea from an old theme I had created. Then, I went to work, breaking as much as anyone could break (<em>don&#8217;t forget that I was also on a mission to find pain points</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a small part of me that remembered exactly why I fell in love with WordPress in the first place. I felt like that same 21-year-old kid who had just learned to edit a theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code> file to make some minor color changes. This was the WordPress that I remembered from so long ago. The one where themes were not 100s of files and 1,000s of lines of code. It was about figuring out how to design for the first time and enjoying every minute of it, <em>warts and all</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m being entirely honest, I probably took things a bit to the extreme. After looking at a few other variations, I realized I had customized quite a bit more than most folks. This is not necessarily a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; thing. Rather, it was more of a <em>Justin-does-not-know-when-to-stop</em> thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, with a looming deadline for submission, I was unable to customize every feature that I had in mind. There are simply so many possibilities that I could have continued working on this for weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bad: Lingering Pain Points</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage view of custom style variation.\n\n\n\n<p>Between those moments of clarity and jaunts of glee were some rough moments. These were a necessary part of the process&#8212;someone needed to experience them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, why can I not control the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39380\">gap between posts in a Query Loop</a> so that it matches the spacing elsewhere in the theme? There are still missing features or design tools support. Fortunately, some of the issues I either ran into or reported upstream were fixed during this process, such as <code>theme.json</code>-support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43543\"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43587\">duplicate background</a> on the Code block. Plus, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v14.0.0\">Gutenberg 14.0</a> added spacing and typography support for a boatload of blocks, both blockers for many theme authors who have tried to adopt FSE features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming WordPress 6.1 will continue to improve the lives of theme authors who are taking advantage of the <code>theme.json</code> toolset. Compared to a year ago, there are far fewer of those tiny irritations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my initial issues were from building a design based on someone else&#8217;s system. It took me a bit to come to grips with Twenty Twenty-Three&#8217;s slug names, spacing presets, and similar bits. While I have a few opinions on a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38998#issuecomment-1053727408\">standard naming system</a>, there are no right or wrong answers here. Plus, such <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38998\">discussions are a can of worms</a> that would only get in the way of the theme&#8217;s progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to remember that I was skinning an existing theme. It was my job to apply my vision onto the canvas sitting in front of me. Once I was able to get in the right mindset for this project, that&#8217;s when all the fun began.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As I look over the past few weeks, I am genuinely having a hard time remembering any <em>truly</em> frustrating moments. What I recall the most is just having a blast building my Twenty Twenty-Three variation and testing those that others built. I cannot wait for the theme and its curated set of styles to be unveiled to the community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 15:00:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Post Status: Writing is a Challenging But Needed Profession in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=114274\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://poststatus.com/writing-is-a-challenging-but-needed-profession-in-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14334:\"<div class=\"wp-container-25 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The WordPress project, software, and community are equally important.

I started with a focus on freelancing — mainly because that’s what I knew best. It was an area where I had experience and felt like I could be of help to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, WordPress soon became my topic of choice. The more projects I built with the content management system (CMS), the more I wanted to share. There was so much to learn and discover.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>It’s easy to criticize someone or something from afar. For example, there’s a difference between critiquing a random stranger’s parenting style and that of your best friend. Proximity makes a difference.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the software wasn’t my only inspiration. Having attended my first WordCamp in 2011, I was taken aback at how welcoming the WordPress community was. Not only could I level up my design and development skills, but I also had access to this incredible human resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience took me from merely building websites to wanting to be a part of something bigger. The community is what made me truly care about WordPress. And I couldn’t help but want to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Challenges of Writing About WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about WordPress made perfect sense. I wasn’t the greatest developer — but I could share what I’ve learned. I also felt an obligation to ask questions about the direction of the software and how it impacts the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those deeper topics are often difficult to write about. Not only do they require some critical thinking (not my greatest skill), but they also need to strike a delicate balance. Because, while a post may nominally be about software, it’s people that are the real subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, there are significant challenges in writing about WordPress and its community. What follows are some lessons and observations from my journey so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-sometimes-you-re-close-to-your-subjects\">Sometimes You’re Close to Your Subjects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to criticize someone or something from afar. For example, there’s a difference between critiquing a random stranger’s parenting style and that of your best friend. Proximity makes a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That applies to the WordPress community as well. While it’s global and we don’t all know each other personally, there are often connections. You may follow a particular person (or their employer) on social media. There’s a chance you use their product or service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complicates things — especially when there’s a reason to be critical of a situation. For instance, I’ve written about product decisions that I found questionable. One was a plugin that set itself to <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/ethical-dilemma-for-wordpress-plugin-developers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">automatically update</a> without user consent. Another involved a plugin that <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/wordpress-theme-plugin-license-expires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked access</a> to its settings screen after a user’s license expired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use both plugins and have generally enjoyed the experience. Thus, it felt a bit awkward to discuss them publicly. Yet I also felt it was necessary to try and explore various points of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these scenarios, I hope to lay out both sides of an argument and spark a productive discussion. Not everyone’s going to agree — but that’s OK. No rule says the debate has to be comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-have-to-fill-in-the-blanks-when-covering-wordpress-core\">You Have To Fill in the Blanks When Covering WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is difficult to produce and maintain. And when an app is as widely-used as WordPress, the job is even tougher. There’s simply no way to please everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As users, we all have our WordPress pet peeves. In my case, the clutter of the dashboard tends to drive me crazy — especially on content-heavy websites. And the block editor still has several bumps to smooth out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there’s the overall direction of the WordPress project. It’s no secret that a lot of resources have been allocated towards the block editor and Full Site Editing. Meanwhile, this changing landscape can create unease among those who make a living with the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it’s vital to take a closer look at what’s happening. This empowers the community to prepare for change and allows their voices to be heard as things evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several challenges for writers who take on these topics. The biggest is that official information can be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://speckyboy.com/new-wordpress-features-hard-to-find/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">very difficult</a> to find. It may require searching through Slack channels or digging up a post from one of several <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Make WordPress</a> blogs. And, even if you locate something relevant, there may still be some key information missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the decision-making process isn’t always clear to those of us on the outside. A lack of context in this area can lead to speculation. That, in turn, has the potential to create distrust within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about these subjects is a balancing act. You can only work with the facts you have. At the same time, it’s difficult to avoid speculating on how or why a decision was made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-discussing-project-leadership-is-tricky\">Discussing Project Leadership is Tricky</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the WordPress project can be confusing when it comes to leadership. Matt Mullenweg is the co-founder of WordPress. He’s also heavily involved in its direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, he’s the founder of Automattic — a commercial entity that runs WordPress.com, among other products. The company also sponsors a significant number of WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, WordPress is also free and open-source. It depends on volunteers for virtually everything. Except that some contributors are paid by their employers to do so via the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Five for the Future</a> initiative. Got all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a unique and seemingly complex arrangement. The result is a lot of gray area and uncertainty for even avid observers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we typically know the project leads for various tasks, there are still questions about who’s doing what, and where decisions come from. Does Mullenweg have the final say over everything? Do sponsored contributors have more clout than volunteers? Where do the interests of WordPress.org and WordPress.com start to diverge?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are fair questions to ask. And in my experience, they’re very difficult to answer. Once again, the lack of clarity can lead to guessing games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-there-are-people-behind-the-code\">There Are People Behind the Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writers also need to take a measured approach when asking questions or leveling criticism. That’s because we’re not just talking about a product. Human beings make WordPress, and we must consider the impact of what we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the fuzzy details on leadership and decision-making make our job more difficult. We may hypothetically posit a question. But taken out of context, it could read as being hurtful or unfair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic rules of journalism apply — even if you’re not technically a journalist (Full disclosure: I’ve had no formal training in this area). But suffice to say that it’s best to stick to the facts. Making accusations without proof or passing along hearsay does you no favors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when criticizing a feature or decision, we should include a detailed explanation. Instead of simply stating that a theme “is hard to use”, provide examples of <em>why</em> it was difficult. It’s still important to provide context — even if we don’t always get it from our subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we all make mistakes. And even the most careful writers will still face negative feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it comes in the form of an old-fashioned internet troll. But it may also come from a place of misunderstanding. In that case, I’d encourage engaging on a personal level. An honest dialogue can produce positive results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-financial-resources-for-writers-are-scant\">Financial Resources for Writers Are Scant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to cover the important issues and happenings in the WordPress community, it takes time and resources. For most writers in our space, these aren’t easy to come by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several online publications dedicated to the CMS and many more that provide at least some level of coverage. But news, analysis, and opinion aren’t necessarily what they’re looking for. Quick tips, tutorials, and plugin roundups get plenty of clicks and are somewhat evergreen. More importantly, they don’t run the risk of rubbing stakeholders the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the few outlets that do encourage in-depth coverage tend to have very limited budgets. They aren’t full-time gigs. Writers often have to piece together roles at multiple publications. This doesn’t leave much time to dig into a topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, I love having gigs at places like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://speckyboy.com/react-javascript-snippets-ui-elements/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Speckyboy</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thewpminute.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The WP Minute</a>. They’ve helped me to find my voice and feel closer to the WordPress community. But I also consider my situation to be an outlier. There don’t appear to be many opportunities for a writer who wants to take a similar path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet writing is only part of what I do. I’m still a freelance web designer and that makes up the bulk of my income. Writing is a passion and (thankfully) a way to boost my bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like contributing to WordPress core, writing about the software takes some measure of passion. You do it because you love it — not for wealth and accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-journalism-is-a-unique-and-important-niche\">WordPress Journalism Is a Unique and Important Niche</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress project, software, and community are equally important. They all play a role in ensuring growth, progress, and success. A sizeable economy of users, builders, and business owners depends on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why staying informed is vital. And so much of the reporting and learning opportunities come from unofficial sources. These writers help us keep up with the news and teach us how to use new features. They’re a key part of the mission to democratize publishing. I’m honored to play a tiny part in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about WordPress isn’t always easy. There can be several obstacles — not least of which is having access to accurate information. But that hasn’t stopped the many talented bloggers and journalists out there from trying their best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, we need more people within the community who are interested in writing and more places to amplify their voices. WordPress is in a constant state of change, and it takes a dedicated group to spread the word and ask difficult questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>Want to write for Post Status?</strong> Please <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/contact/\">get in touch</a>.<br /><br />We are happy to compensate members of the WordPress community (and Post Status) who have experiences and insights to share or good questions worth exploring — about tech, business, and careers as well as the project and culture of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-26 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vertical-post-status-logo-250.png\" alt=\"Post Status\" class=\"wp-image-86322\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" /></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">You — and your whole team — can <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership\">Join Post Status</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><strong>Build your network.

It\'s still active but the <a href=\"https://builtbywp.com/#faq\">FAQ</a> says, &#8220;Our website design & development services start at $3,500 USD.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there\'s Built by WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/08/30/need-a-website-fast-let-us-do-it-for-you/\">Express</a> — where &#8220;in-house experts will build the site for you, all in four business days or less. The cost is $499, plus an additional purchase of the WordPress.com Premium plan.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no way not to see this <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/do-it-for-me/\">Do it for Me</a> service as competing with freelancers on the low end of the market, which <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/\">Matt Mullenweg</a></strong> previously <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/will-automattics-built-by-wordpress-compete-with-wordpress-freelancers/\">claimed</a> was not the intention of the premium site building service last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also estimated that <strong>Automattic</strong> captures less than 5% of the revenue in the total WordPress ecosystem — much less than other large hosts. At the time, <strong>David Bisset</strong> writing for Post Status, asked for more transparency about &#8220;how many customers have been acquired and new sites built on WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress market share has always been highest and expanded the most in the broadest market — the top million active websites as measured by traffic. WordPress currently has around a 36% market share by that measure, but it falls to 14% in the top 10,000 most active sites. While sites with no (identifiable) CMS are still the largest and probably easiest area for growth, it\'s logical for WordPress.com to focus on the lower end of the market rather than leave it to other hosting companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably, freelancers are going to feel the squeeze as commodified websites and website building services compete downward on price. The wisdom usually offered about this is sound: learn the price points where you can be most competitive and trade on unique value you can bring to clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A geographically localized focus, an affinity-based or purpose-built niche of features, and personal referral networks are unique strengths. There are also plenty of important, high-budget clients whose websites never need or intend to serve millions of visitors. Built your own local or niche market analysis — current market share data for WordPress doesn\'t tell you much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade ago, <strong>Chris Butler</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://www.newfangled.com/report-the-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-a/\">survey and report</a> at <strong>Newfangled</strong> for other small agencies was really helpful in <a href=\"https://www.newfangled.com/the-results-of-newfangleds-state-of-digital-marketing-for-small-agencies-survey/\">getting the numbers that matter</a>. (I believe this survey was done more than once but not sustained over the years since then.)

He also shares how he has developed an approach to using technology in order to overcome longstanding difficulties with his eyesight.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this People of WordPress series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1014\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-aug-powp.jpg?resize=1014%2C627&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus playing the guitar\" class=\"wp-image-13341\" /><em>Bud Kraus</em> with his guitar\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your understanding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud has taught web design since 1998, with students from more than 80 countries online or in person. He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br /><br />But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" /><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" />Bud Kraus\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br /><br />He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person. He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global reach and meaning through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=600%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus with Josepha\" class=\"wp-image-13342\" /><em>Bud Kraus with Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WordCamp Montclair, NJ 2022</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress. He in turn is an advocate for the community around open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The software is really good, and the people are even better.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I get a sense of accomplishment whenever I launch a new or redesigned site. It’s also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world from my <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&speakers=bud-kraus\">talks and presentations</a>.

A basket of goods purchased in the USA with USD is compared to the price of that same basket in a given country, in that country’s local currency. This ratio is never identical to the actual local currency exchange rate against USD. In fact, in some countries it’s much lower, which means that those goods can only be purchased using less USD than would be required in the USA.</p><p>Based on this metric, the PPP value helps with redefining prices. To better illustrate this, based on PPP data from the last 5 years, those in India may receive discounts of up to 75% on Business Bloomer WooCommerce online courses, those in South Africa may receive a 59% discount, Norway students may receive no discount, and so on. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 14:51:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: #41 – Laura Nelson on How To Create a Profitable Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=137279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/41-laura-nelson-on-how-to-create-a-profitable-newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42472:\"<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/laurora/\">Laura Nelson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is a Content Marketer at WooCommerce where she’s responsible for creating and planning engaging content for their users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to WooCommerce she worked at <a href=\"https://www.mailpoet.com/\">MailPoet</a>, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and before that, she worked at Pragmatic, a UK based WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She’s on the show to share her experience about how you can, and why you might want to, set up a paid email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I hear the word newsletter, I’m typically thinking of the information which drops into your inbox on a regular basis.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how WordPress can be the backbone of a profitable newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to share on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Laura Nelson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is a content marketer at WooCommerce, where she&#8217;s responsible for creating and planning engaging content for their users. Prior to WooCommerce she worked at MailPoet, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and before that she worked at Pragmatic, a UK based WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s on the show to explore her experience of how you can, and while you might want to set up a paid email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I hear the word newsletter, I&#8217;m typically thinking about the information which drops into your inbox on a daily basis. We&#8217;ve all surrendered our email addresses in return for some product or service. We agree to receive emails on the understanding that we can unsubscribe at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a few of these emails really resonate with you, but it&#8217;s likely that you unsubscribed from many as the content was no longer wanted. This kind of email marketing is not always viewed favorably, and it&#8217;s not the kind of technique that Laura is talking about on the podcast today. Her pitch is that email newsletters can themselves be a product? That people will pay to receive your emails, and she&#8217;s got data and examples to back it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose that the closest analogy would be people who create an online course. You have an area of expertise. You do the hard work of creating the course and people will pay for a membership to have the benefit of learning from your expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is describing something similar to that. The only difference being that instead of a course, people will pay to receive your emails, knowing that you&#8217;re going to bring value to them regularly. I know that this can be done because as you will hear, I&#8217;m a ,subscriber to some of the emails which Laura mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a get rich quick scheme. It&#8217;s hard work and you&#8217;ve got to cultivate your audience and give them something of value, repeatedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were a play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One last thing to mention is that I&#8217;ll be attending WordCamp US next week. And as a result there won&#8217;t be a podcast episode. If you&#8217;re going to be there. I do hope that our paths cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the podcast, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes of there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Laura Nelson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Laura Nelson. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] Laura Nelson: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] Nathan Wrigley: Laura did a talk yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Laura Nelson: Yesterday afternoon. Yep. So I&#8217;m feeling pretty good today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re feeling happy. Yeah, she did a talk at WordCamp Europe, 2022. What was it entitled? What was it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] Laura Nelson: It was how to create a paid newsletter subscription in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and did it go well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] Laura Nelson: I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: So we&#8217;re gonna be talking today about newsletters. Obviously newsletters, they do seem to be all the rage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] Laura Nelson: Yeah, every so often you hear like, email is dead, it&#8217;s all about TikTok and in fairness it is all about TikTok at the moment. But email marketing is amazing way to speak to your customers or your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] Nathan Wrigley: Does the data back that up then? Reliably over the last 20 years, we can say email still works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah. And conversion rates are far higher from email marketing than they are from like, if you tweet about your product or your services. Email marketing is golden in terms of conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s interesting. Just the interface is a little bit more, how to describe it? TikTok&#8217;s a bit more ephemeral. There&#8217;s a lot going on, and there&#8217;s a lot making you wish to scroll past all of the things. I think it&#8217;s the only thing that&#8217;s been with me for 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] Laura Nelson: Exactly. People are familiar with it. They know how it works, they know what to expect from an email. I think you&#8217;re capturing people at a good time, because generally they&#8217;re not gonna open their emails unless they have time to read your email. Whereas if you are like on Twitter and you&#8217;re like idly scrolling or you&#8217;ve got like two minutes, it forces them to stop, but they might not have time to take that information in. So email, it&#8217;s nice. It sits there. If you don&#8217;t have time to read it properly when you first open it, you can come back to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:53] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. I was just thinking about that. And if I don&#8217;t log into Twitter for a few days, there&#8217;s almost no chance that I&#8217;m gonna see the things from three days ago, because I&#8217;m gonna start at the top. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you&#8217;re talking about newsletters, presumably we&#8217;re talking about a piece where people have subscribed to a newsletter, and you are then offering content to them. Is that basically the model?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:16] Laura Nelson: That&#8217;s right, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, and you are talking about getting paid and generating revenue, and it almost sounds like it&#8217;s too good to be true. You throw together a newsletter and suddenly, you become incredibly wealthy. Of course that&#8217;s not the case. There&#8217;s probably a lot of hard work. There&#8217;s probably a lot of expertise required. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:33] Laura Nelson: Yes. I&#8217;d say the hardest part of this is building your list. So if you don&#8217;t already have people in your community or your audience available, you probably have to put a bit more effort into marketing. But in terms of expertise, you can write a newsletter about anything you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The example I gave in my talk yesterday was a newsletter about cats, and that&#8217;s an interest. I&#8217;m not an expert on cats, I just think cats are cute. And so, you can use them in whatever ways you want. I definitely don&#8217;t think you have to be an expert in a specific subject. If you are good at writing, or if you have interesting or unusual opinions about things, you can easily make an email newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:11] Nathan Wrigley: Before we pressed record, we talked about the fact that there is a rival platform, which I think by now probably most people have heard of. It&#8217;s called Substack. And you likened what you were describing in the talk and probably what we&#8217;re gonna be talking about as a, kind of an alternative to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:26] Laura Nelson: Yes. That&#8217;s right. Substack is huge now, and I can&#8217;t remember the figures off the top of my head, but there are millions of subscribers across all the Substack newsletters, I guess you&#8217;d call them. And the solution that I&#8217;m gonna be talking to you about is an alternative to keep that in WordPress, rather than outsourcing that to a different platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] Nathan Wrigley: Is there a strong reason in your head why you would not wish to go with the, it&#8217;s the SaaS versus WordPress argument. You could have this about a thousand different SaaS platforms. But is there a strong reason in your head why you wish to do it in WordPress and not just pay Substack the fee and get on with it over there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] Laura Nelson: I think WordPress, I mean, WordPress lends itself to content. Like WordPress is where you publish content. And we&#8217;re talking about sharing content in a newsletter. And I think like this method, what most appeals about it to me is the fact that everything is in one place, and it&#8217;s familiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a WordPress website or a business that&#8217;s using WordPress to power it then you don&#8217;t have to learn something new, it&#8217;s already, it&#8217;s just there. It can be extended onto what you are already doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:27] Nathan Wrigley: The payment bit, we&#8217;ll probably unpick the payment puzzle, but is this basically a paywall thing? In other words, are you restricting content? Are you only sending out to people who&#8217;ve paid? Or is it that you embed other things inside the newsletters, you know, upsells and subscriptions that people might join and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:44] Laura Nelson: No, no, you are only sending the content to those who&#8217;ve paid. So it&#8217;s like a subscription, like you would, sign up to like a, I think you can get them for like dog and cat food, where they get delivered regularly. Then you, yeah, just like that. But instead you&#8217;re receiving content in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:58] Nathan Wrigley: So you are going to describe to us a system built where you go to the website, you&#8217;re engaged, you sign up, you begin receiving emails and if your subscription payment is cancelled, the emails fail, and it stops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:09] Laura Nelson: Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:11] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so what plugins are you using?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:13] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so in addition to like being on a WordPress website, so disclaimer, I mean, if you&#8217;re not on WordPress, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re listening to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:19] Nathan Wrigley: No, that&#8217;s probably fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;ll need like WooCommerce, MailPoet, which is an email marketing plugin for WordPress, and WooCommerce subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] Nathan Wrigley: So the basic WooCommerce to sort of bind the whole subscription thing together. You add the subscription thing on top. And then there&#8217;s MailPoet. Is there any cost to any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:36] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so WooCommerce subscriptions is $199 per year. MailPoet is free to use up to a thousand subscribers. So when you get beyond that, there&#8217;s tiered plans. But I think the lowest plan starts at around $12 or $15 per month. It&#8217;s quite reasonable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve heard, and I don&#8217;t know where this number comes from, but I&#8217;ve heard that if your email list is a thousand people, roughly you can become profitable. And what I mean by that is that you can become profitable enough for it to become an important part of what you do. And it always felt that that was like a really, quite a low number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then having tried to create email lists in the past, I quickly realized actually a thousand is pretty hard to get to. It&#8217;s difficult to get people to surrender their email address. So is there any advice that you give to people essentially to give you their email address?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah. I think what works best is honesty. Be upfront and honest about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending to them. That you&#8217;re not gonna pass on your, their email to somebody else. And when you&#8217;re going to, like the frequency that they can expect to receive emails from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s just a case of making sure that the content that you&#8217;re including in it is really valuable, offers something a bit different or unique that they might not be able to read elsewhere. I mean, that&#8217;s like solid advice for if it&#8217;s a paid newsletter or not paid. And then it&#8217;s just another form of marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend including, including a link to sign up in all of your normal email signatures, like from your Gmail or whatever you use. Use your social networks. If you have a good community on Twitter, let them know about your newsletter. Basically, plug it everywhere that you possibly can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] Nathan Wrigley: Does the MailPoet solution, does it allow you to create, so forgive me, first of all, I&#8217;ve not used MailPoet, so I don&#8217;t know how the UI works, but does it allow you to basically create a post in WordPress, which is then fired out as an email?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] Laura Nelson: Yes and no. So if you mean like a post in WordPress that you&#8217;d be able to go onto a WordPress website and see it in like the blog section. It wouldn&#8217;t work that way around. If you had published a blog post on WordPress and then use MailPoet to send an email, it&#8217;s a tick, like a widget, that you drag in and a tick that and you can include that entire blog post in your email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:45] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you create a normal blog post. Tick a box. When you click publish, it is converted to an email and sent out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Or you drag it into like your email template, and you can add other stuff around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:56] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, okay. So you could put a different header and a different footer in? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] Laura Nelson: And in the case of the paid news letter though, you&#8217;d probably, in order to get people to sign up and pay for this, you don&#8217;t want that content being available on your website for free. So you&#8217;d probably want to write the post within the email itself. So it only lives there and not elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] Nathan Wrigley: Yes, that wouldn&#8217;t make sense, would it? If it was a paid newsletter, and the content was available on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:21] Laura Nelson: But you could use WooCommerce memberships. You could guard that and make it a private post and then link to it it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:27] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So as with all things WordPress, there&#8217;s a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can add another layer to this if you want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:32] Nathan Wrigley: If somebody was to begin a completely new website. You know, they wanna talk about, I dunno, volcanoes or something. Then would you be able to do this on pretty modest hosting? Because it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lot going on. Basic WordPress, basic WooCommerce, a couple of extra plugins, maybe really cheap hosting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:50] Laura Nelson: Uh, yeah. Really, unless you are planning on adding loads of other products to your store or adding loads and loads of other content to your website. You can keep this really lean and get away with really cheap posting. It wouldn&#8217;t take much, you just need a product page really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] Nathan Wrigley: The difficulty I think maybe is trying to get people to find your newsletter in the first place. And then of course there&#8217;s the problem of getting them to separate their email and give it to you. Have you got any advice for how you market your newsletter? Anything around there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:21] Laura Nelson: Yeah. It&#8217;s funny. Someone asked me this yesterday after the talk and I, I said I could probably do an entire other presentation on this exact topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] Nathan Wrigley: Go deep, it&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] Laura Nelson: So, what I was saying earlier about being really upfront about what you&#8217;re gonna be sending, when you&#8217;re gonna be sending it. Know what you&#8217;re doing with their email address. And you just really need to show some value. So you need to make sure that the content that you are creating is unique or if you do have an expertise in a certain area, really let people know, like why that&#8217;s important to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content is all about problem solving for people. So you need to find out what problems people have. And if you can solve that in content, then let them know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that some things are going to be more of a labour of love than other things. Again if you&#8217;re producing the volcano newsletter, I&#8217;m expecting in the low single digits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] Laura Nelson: Well you know, it&#8217;s a niche market I imagine. Maybe that would be more successful because you know, you get people who are really into something like that. You know, there&#8217;s probably not a lot. I dunno, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not familiar with the volcano market. I&#8217;m not gonna lie, but, um, I kind of imagine there will be those niche areas like that, where if there&#8217;s not content being published about that or at least readily available to you, then you probably would pay. It&#8217;s like, oh yeah, I love that, and I&#8217;m really interested in that. So I would pay to receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:40] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting because of course you&#8217;ve gotta think about the person reading the content and whether volcanoes are gonna be of any interest to them, but also your ability to sustain this, is directly related to how interested you think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, if you genuinely have no interest in volcanoes and you embark on that mission, probably it&#8217;s gonna dry up fairly quickly, and so I wonder if often people in this chase the big thing, the big shiny, exciting thing only to discover, you know, what, actually on a deep, personal level, I&#8217;m not interested in this, and the newsletter dries up and falters and fails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:16] Laura Nelson: If you&#8217;re thinking about starting this up, you need to remember, it&#8217;s not just one email. It&#8217;s not just two. It has to have like longevity to it. So whatever it is, whatever topic you&#8217;re choosing, obviously you can&#8217;t possibly know what you might like to talk about or write about in six months time, but you need to make sure that the topic is either big enough or is like new things are happening in that area enough in order to sustain a long term newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] Nathan Wrigley: I wonder if this is like a perfect extension to people who are already doing things. They might have got a YouTube channel. They might have a WordPress website and they&#8217;re producing things. Or in this case here we are on a podcast. It may be that you&#8217;ve got that kind of thing. It feels like a bit of a no brainer to just add this on as a kind of value add. So you could have, well, I don&#8217;t know, content that only subscribers get, or things like that. Is that where the market seems to be leading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. You obviously can start from scratch and it, technically it&#8217;s pretty easy to do so, in that respect. But, you&#8217;re gonna have more success if you already have, you need to make sure you already have an audience. And if you already have a business, you already have a customer base or an audience that are, are listening to you, and you&#8217;re communicating with. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s an obvious, like an easy fit for established businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So if you&#8217;ve got something going already. It&#8217;s almost like a missing piece of the jigsaw if you&#8217;re not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:39] Laura Nelson: It&#8217;s not to be used to like plug your products or services. It&#8217;s not like, I guess if you were to run a, an eCommerce store and you sell products, it&#8217;s not to be used like that. It&#8217;s like a highlight of, oh, we got these new trainers in stock etc. You have to be adding something of value, like an opinion or some content that they can&#8217;t get elsewhere. I think one of the, um, examples I gave yesterday was digital downloads. Like if you&#8217;re really good photographer, you could share your photos in an email newsletter and let have access to use your photos, you know? Like on a weekly basis like, 10 new photos every week or fortnight or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:18] Nathan Wrigley: So this is subscription, which means we must decide on a subscription term. Do you typically, would you say like go monthly? Is that, is that the easiest, least friction way to do it? Sort of asking people to separate money from their wallet, monthly, annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] Laura Nelson: I&#8217;d offer both a monthly option and then a yearly, maybe it would just slightly discounted. Because it&#8217;s great. If you have people signed up for a year or they&#8217;ve committed to that year, that&#8217;s excellent. But I&#8217;d always give people the option of monthly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:45] Nathan Wrigley: My fear of offering an annual plan would be that I just dry up. You know, I&#8217;d be eight months in and I&#8217;d be, ah, I&#8217;ve got nothing else to say, and then I&#8217;ve got to think about the, the sort of refund process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:58] Laura Nelson: Yeah. If you do that, you would probably have to refund people, but offering a yearly option is something you could consider after you&#8217;ve got into the groove of creating a newsletter and you think you can see it has a longer life to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I know this, what we&#8217;ve been talking about is a WordPress thing. The piece that you described, the MailPoet and the WooCommerce bit is the way to get paid for that. Just briefly talking about alternative ways of doing that. The sponsorship bit, or the payment bit outside of WordPress. There&#8217;s things like Patreon and Ko-fi is that, an angle you&#8217;ve ever looked at or explored?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:30] Laura Nelson: Yeah, and like Substack. They&#8217;re all like really great platforms to use. But they&#8217;re outside of WordPress. So, I think the kind of unique angle here or for this approach is, if you want everything to be all in one place, if you&#8217;re already creating content in WordPress, don&#8217;t spend your time copying and pacing it over to a different piece of software. You can have it all like in one dashboard, basically. Ownership is a big part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Nathan Wrigley: Thorny question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:01] Laura Nelson: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:01] Nathan Wrigley: Where are the email addresses stored?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] Laura Nelson: Right? So in MailPoet, no one else can see your subscriber&#8217;s email addresses. MailPoet takes, email best practices and security very seriously. We don&#8217;t even see the emails that get sent out via MailPoet. So they&#8217;re stored on, I think it&#8217;s like your server, they belong with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:22] Nathan Wrigley: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:23] Laura Nelson: They don&#8217;t come to MailPoet at any point. They are yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:26] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s an interesting thing. And I guess you would need to be mindful of GDPR if you are storing people&#8217;s email addresses. Do you have any insight into whether those are in the database? Do you know whether they&#8217;re in an encrypted, in an encrypted form or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:40] Laura Nelson: This is a technical question that I am not able to answer, I&#8217;m afraid. At least not confidently. I think I know the answer, but I absolutely wouldn&#8217;t want to go on a podcast and tell everybody the wrong thing if that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s okay we could could look at that another time. And so have you got any good examples of newsletters where you could say, go and have a look at that one. Two or three that you think are really worthwhile where somebody&#8217;s done it just right. They&#8217;re doing really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] Laura Nelson: So the first one&#8217;s called Dense Discovery. None of these examples are actually of paid, well, actually I can give some paid newsletter examples. Let me start with Dense Discovery, which you can pay for, but they handle the payment a slightly different way. It&#8217;s more like a tip based system. Like if you enjoy this, you know, become a friend of the newsletter. But from a content perspective, I would pay to receive Dense Discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they offered it up as a subscription, I would do that. Cause I tip on a regular basis. It has a really good balance of the guy who&#8217;s created the newsletter called Kai, like his opinion, and his take on what&#8217;s happening in the world. There are some lovely resources for like design. He often shares like an illustrator and their work, as well as some like handy tools for like productivity at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind like a nice, a nice blend of content. And it&#8217;s really regular. I know when I&#8217;m gonna receive it. It&#8217;s the same time each week, and I know the quality of the content&#8217;s gonna be really, really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:01] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just pause you there, and just go on a bit of a segue and we&#8217;ll come back to some other ones in a minute, because that just suddenly occurred to me. There&#8217;s something a bit meta going on there, because he&#8217;s not asking for a subscription, but what if you had an email newsletter, which was a, the sort of upsell for the paid newsletter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] Laura Nelson: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] Nathan Wrigley: If you know what I mean? So the newsletter itself contains a proportion of the content. Is that a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:24] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely. And actually the next example I was going to give. I&#8217;d like to like add to disclaimer it, this isn&#8217;t of my interest but&#8217;s I can see it&#8217;s done really, really well, which is why I&#8217;m gonna mention it. It&#8217;s called Daily Coding Problem. So it uses this paid newsletter technique really interestingly. It&#8217;s basically they send like a coding problem. It&#8217;s designed to help programmers prepare for technical interviews. And if you are only a free subscriber, you don&#8217;t get to see the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:53] Nathan Wrigley: Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:53] Laura Nelson: Uhhuh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nathan Wrigley: That is intriguing. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of like using the annoyance style isn&#8217;t it? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:58] Laura Nelson: So I mean, if you&#8217;re really confident with these, maybe you don&#8217;t, maybe you don&#8217;t need to see them, like the mystery. Yeah, you have to become a paid subscriber to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. So throw something out there. It&#8217;s a bit like if Wordle didn&#8217;t give you the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] Laura Nelson: I know. How annoying would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: Well, you&#8217;d pay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:16] Laura Nelson: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] Nathan Wrigley: And you&#8217;d get the answer every, every day. Yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating. So I mean that&#8217;s really unique isn&#8217;t it? But presumably most of it is about just the kind of stuff that you would ordinarily put on your website. You just make sure that the content&#8217;s really good, but you indicate they&#8217;ve got to the end of this newsletter, but there&#8217;s more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:32] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:32] Nathan Wrigley: You could find out more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] Laura Nelson: Absolutely. And another example, um, which I mentioned yesterday actually was Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:38] Nathan Wrigley: Oh. I pay for Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:40] Laura Nelson: You&#8217;re newsletter subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s fascinating. I hadn&#8217;t connected. I use the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] Nathan Wrigley: But it is a newsletter, is and he got me through the newsletter. You&#8217;re right. Go on, tell them about Jack&#8217;s Flight Club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] Laura Nelson: Yeah, so Jack&#8217;s Flight Club, as we just heard, is, it&#8217;s a really popular one, uh, in the UK and Europe. And it sends you like error fairs and cheap flight deals. But if you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber, you don&#8217;t get all of the deals. And when you get the free version of email, they tell you which deals that you missed. So it really plays on that, like FOMO, like, you know, you&#8217;ve missed these incredibly cheap flights to Canada. You didn&#8217;t get that because you&#8217;re not a paid subscriber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s right. And the interesting thing about that one is. That&#8217;s kind of opened my eyes up actually about where the price points may be. And maybe, maybe Jack is different, but it&#8217;s about if I recall, I think I paid about $40, something like that per year. So it was not really a lot. If you spread that over the, you know, it&#8217;s like $3 80 or a month</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s really not a significant amount, but presumably if Jack, I&#8217;m guessing there is a Jack, I don&#8217;t know, but presumably if Jack&#8217;s into the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. This</p>\n\n\n\n<p>is incredible… a million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:52] Laura Nelson: He&#8217;s got a million subscribers, million plus, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:55] Nathan Wrigley: We can work the maths out there. Okay Jack&#8217;s doing well from newsletters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Laura Nelson: Jack&#8217;s doing alright. Well, it&#8217;s the success of a newsletter that enabled him to take it to an app and, you know, grow this beyond just email content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:06] Nathan Wrigley: I want to be Jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:08] Laura Nelson: Yeah, me too. I bet he&#8217;s on a yacht somewhere lovely, right. He&#8217;s not looking up cheap flights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] Nathan Wrigley: He&#8217;s no longer looking, but that really illustrates it perfectly. So it was something most people probably don&#8217;t care about flights at all. They&#8217;ll just look the flight when they&#8217;re going on holiday but here&#8217;s me, I&#8217;m intrigued. I want if there is a cheap deal out there. So it&#8217;s got me on that niche thing. Like the coding chap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I don&#8217;t know how long it took me. I think he was probably giving me the free one for six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] Laura Nelson: Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know what he also did, which was curious, which was actually the hook. He offered a 20% discount in one of his emails. So that&#8217;s another interesting pricing strategy. He had his annual price and then he, for a week only, I think it was 20% off. That was the, the fishing rod that I happily bit on. And, and I think he&#8217;s got me for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah. You can do that with this, and I&#8217;d recommend exploring things like that. Just jumping back to your question earlier about how to get paid subscribers. If you already run a successful newsletter, you can drop in the bit about you having a paid newsletter too, give &#8217;em a little taster of what they&#8217;ve missed or what they will miss if they don&#8217;t pay to subscribe and yeah, it got you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:17] Nathan Wrigley: It works. And interestingly enough, I am pretty difficult to get, and yet he got me. So it is, it is about the niche I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Laura Nelson: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Nathan Wrigley: Well, let&#8217;s talk about the actual email itself. So we open up the email. Are there any sort of top tips about the way you should present things? I mean, are we looking for bright and colorful? Are we looking for more words than images? Are there trip wires that prevent the email clients from opening things? Because there&#8217;s just way too much text and it truncates it. Just give us what the email actually should be looking like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] Laura Nelson: Well, I mean, it does completely depend, like what you&#8217;re including in it. I wouldn&#8217;t be, if you are selling a like long form content style email, don&#8217;t be afraid of including lots of words. Because that&#8217;s what people are paying for. But in terms of spam filters, if you&#8217;re offering a paid newsletter subscription, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have any issues because it&#8217;s usually things like the word free and like capital letters, lots of exclamation marks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] Nathan Wrigley: Emojis in the subject line, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] Laura Nelson: Emojis in the subject line are okay, as long as they&#8217;re not overused. Yeah. Basically emails like don&#8217;t overdo anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:20] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] Laura Nelson: A good, combination of yeah, different things that works well. In terms of layout, I mean, just take a step back and think about what you&#8217;d like to read. If it&#8217;s a big wall of text, would that entice you to read it? I mean, some people maybe, but not no. So, and you can format the newsletter to look how you want. So you could add spaces, you can add some images, you can use columns if that&#8217;s better for your content, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] Nathan Wrigley: The last time I was fiddling with email, I think we&#8217;re still stuck in tables. Are there big constraints still about the way that you can present things? So obviously on the web, our own WordPress websites, we can literally put anything anywhere, pixel by pixel, more or less. Are we confined with emails still? I mean are we still thinking about email clients from the year 2004 as a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:06] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Well, I mean email&#8217;s tricky because it will look different according to different email clients, and Outlook is forever a bug bear for those who create emails. But if you&#8217;re using email marketing software, I mean, I can only speak to MailPoet, and I&#8217;m not just trying to plug here. It&#8217;s just the one I&#8217;m most familiar with. Their templates are already fully responsive. Their templates are tested on all the different email clients. So you can kind of be pretty confident that unless you&#8217;ve gone in and really messed with that, they&#8217;re gonna work in most email clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litmus is a great tool if you&#8217;re not sure. Email on Acid to test your emails, to see what they&#8217;re going to look like on Outlook, on Gmail, all the big email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] Nathan Wrigley: And how do they work? You send Email on Acid an actual email and it then tells you, it gives you a rating or things to improve and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:54] Laura Nelson: It will show you how they look across the different email clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:58] Nathan Wrigley: Tell us about the actual UI, about how you build email. I&#8217;ve logged into all sorts of services. Typically there&#8217;s a bunch of modules for want of a better word, a bit like in Gutenberg with blocks now. So you drag in a, an image and you could drag in a couple of columns and put the image to the left, and text to the right. Is it what you see is what you get kind of builder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] Laura Nelson: Yeah. Yeah. It is a WYSIWYG builder. It doesn&#8217;t use Gutenberg but I know the MailPoet team are looking to explore that option. But the email itself is a WYSIWYG editor where you drag and drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:30] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s familiar? You&#8217;ll be right at home. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:32] Laura Nelson: I don&#8217;t like describing things as easy because I think different people have different perceptions of what&#8217;s easy, but this is the easiest email editor I&#8217;ve ever used, because it is simply you drag it and you drop it where you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:46] Nathan Wrigley: Do you get an opportunity to inspect it before you commit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] Laura Nelson: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] Nathan Wrigley: So it will send you a version you can inspect make sure the links are all working and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:56] Laura Nelson: Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] Nathan Wrigley: And does it check that stuff as well? So in other words, it will see that for example, you&#8217;ve overused images, Nathan. Stop with the images volcanoes. Or that there&#8217;s too much text typically.

If you head to the blog, there&#8217;s some really great articles there about email marketing in general. How to build your list. There&#8217;s even a blog post about creating a paid newsletter. Like what my talk was on yesterday. Fantastic resource for all things email marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:04] Nathan Wrigley: Well Laura, well done for getting through your talk at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:07] Laura Nelson: Thank you.

Varghese is founder of FlyingProxy, a competing company, and identifies himself as a &#8220;performance enthusiast.&#8221; He accused the plugin of &#8220;cheating Pagespeed and other tools&#8221; by hiding JavaScript files from loading when users test their sites through popular performance testing tools. The code uses an odd set of obfuscated names for the testing tools, which drew his suspicion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese neglected to mention in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GijoVarghese_/status/1563097754322501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1563097754322501632%7Ctwgr%5Ebf97b211fb13920391541b64137000b5ea1edc0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-optimize-plugin-accused-of-cheating-pagespeed-and-other-performance-testing-tools\">tweet</a> that this is what happens when one of the plugin&#8217;s settings under Minify > JS is set to defer JavaScript. There are two radio button settings but they are confusing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first radio button allows users to defer selected JavaScript files. It says the files will be loaded asynchronously (not the same as defer), and then it also says that users should select the first radio button if they want to exclude scripts from page speed tests. It is not clear how the scripts will be loaded for the user or for testing sites. Excluding is not the same as deferring, so in this case the settings UI is somewhat misleading and should be more clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The second radio option is for users who are simply looking to defer all JavaScript. If one selects <em>&#8220;Defer using JavaScript (Use this method if you require support for <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp\">older browsers</a>),&#8221;</em> it should do exactly what it describes in the link:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>If the <code>defer</code> attribute is set, it specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> Even though the UI says it is deferring all files, WP-Optimize never loads the JavaScript for performance testing sites. In this second option, the exclusion of testing sites happens without the users&#8217; permission. If users had wanted that, they would have selected the previous radio button and explicitly identified which scripts to exclude.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese left out some significant details in his original report, but it was accurate in that certain settings are misleading about what they actually do. He demonstrated this in a follow-up video where there is no manual entry of any scripts to exclude and the second radio option is checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re providing an option for users to cheat testing tools,&#8221; Varghese said. &#8220;Also, using names like &#8216;ighth&#8217; for Lighthouse and &#8216;tmetr&#8217; for GTmetrix clearly shows what they&#8217;re trying to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most of the users try disabling and enabling different features to see which one is increasing the speed/scores in testing tools.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese contends there is no need to do things differently for testing tools and humans, as this can be confusing for site owners. His allegation left out significant details and implied that all of this is hidden in the code. It is for one of the settings but not the other one. The interface implies that you must enter scripts manually to exclude from testing, but this is also misleading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-Optimize <a href=\"https://getwpo.com/wp-optimize-completely-rejects-false-allegations-of-gaming-page-speed-results/\">published a public response to the allegations</a> today, but has not revealed any of the results from the code investigation they completed. Instead, the company cited a video created by Peter Wilkinson from <a href=\"https://diviengine.com/\">Divi Engine</a>, who claims that users must manually enter scripts to make testing sites exclude them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkinson is quoted as concluding that &#8220;Gijo Varghese has used deception to promote Flying Pages and Flying Press&#8221; in bringing this issue to public attention on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In reality (from my research) WP-Optimize do not &#8216;cheat&#8217; Pagespeed tools when you install or Minify your JavaScript,&#8221; Wilkinson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To &#8216;cheat&#8217; the tools, you need to manually add the JS files you want to asynchronous load to a setting that clearly has the label &#8216;Use this if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix…)\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the case. The easiest way to test is to install the plugin, turn on &#8220;defer all JavaScript,&#8221; and then view the source to see that performance tools are excluded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WP-Optimize&#8217;s public response to the issue did not include anything from their code investigation, I contacted them again. Their deputy lead Venkat Raj was not available to answer why other settings in the plugin silently remove JS for performance testing tools with the click of a radio button. Joe Miles, head of strategy for the company, shared the last information he received on the issue from Venkat Raj: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The advanced setting used in the allegation is actually useful to find out whether the essential js/css files are actually slowing down the web page or not.  This feature is by default, turned ‘off’ and only enabled by advanced users who know what they’re doing.<br /><br />&#8220;You may use this feature if you have a completely independent script or would like to exclude scripts from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)<br /><br />&#8220;Independent scripts are for example &#8216;analytics&#8217; or &#8216;pixel&#8217; scripts. They are not required for the website to work. &#8216;<em>Use this if you have a completely independent stylesheet or would like to exclude stylesheets from page speed tests (PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix&#8230;)</em>&#8216;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies to the first radio button. The second button does not have any indication that it will turn off all scripts when using testing tools &#8211; nor does WP-Optimize&#8217;s team seem to be aware that it is available with the click of a radio button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miles could not confirm whether this is how it is intended to work or if it is a bug. He also could not account for why the names of the popular testing sites were obfuscated in the code, but said the original developer &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work for us as it&#8217;s open source code repurposed from elsewhere.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, we believe this is a distraction from the false allegations, and what matters is that the UI is very clear for the settings are for, so users aren&#8217;t deceived,&#8221; Miles said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raul Peixoto, author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/\">Fast Velocity Minify</a> (FVM), the plugin from which WP-Optimize copied the code, said he can confirm that this code was part of FVM but said it was not used in the same way:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The purpose of such code on FVM was completely different than the one on WP Optimize and furthermore it required for the users to manually enable this option via wp-admin (it was disabled by default).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of that code was to selectively test the impact of new scripts or plugins in performance, and help developers decide if they should refactor, remove or replace heavy plugins or scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This existed on FVM to answer questions like these:<br />“I have a production site and my performance is low. What would be the performance if this plugin was simply not here, but without actually removing it from the site for regular users yet?”<br />“What would the performance be if I could defer all scripts, or specific scripts that are not currently compatible with defer, before actually doing that change for everyone?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An official explanation regarding its use on FVM is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-are-some-scripts-not-loaded-for-speed-testing-sites/\">available in the plugin&#8217;s support forum</a> as of this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I suppose that the developers hired by WP Optimize did not understand what this was doing on FVM or under what settings, or perhaps, they may have felt tempted to use it as a hack,&#8221; Peixoto said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We should also carefully remember that at that time, there were still no web vitals metrics publicly available, so using something like this would have yield better &#8216;measurable&#8217; results, thus offering a product advantage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piexoto said he &#8220;felt compelled&#8221; to remove this code two years ago because of how often it was abused by developers who were cheating on tests for their clients:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Fast forward some time, and I realized that some developers were actually using this to cheat on the tests for their clients, so I felt compelled to make the decision on FVM 3 (already late 2020) to remove this feature, which was met by a lot of protests of angry developers when their clients started complaining that their scores went down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried at that time, to explain that having a good score was not the same as having good web vitals metrics, but eventually I gave up on that, as some people cared more about the test results than the actual performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After FVM 3 release, I am basically just maintaining it and doing small bug fixes when reported, as I have to focus on other things. I have removed that function and fixed a couple of bugs that were pending on version 3.2.9 and pushed an update, so thank you for referring this to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For whatever reason, UpdraftPlus chose to merge this code into WP-Optimize in 2020 and, as reported yesterday, hasn&#8217;t touched the code since. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What appeared to be a black and white issue yesterday is a more nuanced situation. WP-Optimize&#8217;s implementation of FVM&#8217;s code is poorly documented in the UI and misleading about how the scripts are loaded. It can lead site owners to activating it without being advanced users, and historically has a high potential for abuse. When Varghese discovered it, he exposed it in an inflammatory way, feeling certain he had found wrongdoing because of how inexplicably obfuscated the code is. This compounded the issue but started a broader, important conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should users have this kind of easy access (two clicks) to turning off scripts for performance testing tools?

UpdraftPlus acquired WP-Optimize in 2016 and claims that the tool &#8220;has everything you need to keep your website fast and thoroughly optimized.&#8221; A <a href=\"https://getwpo.com/\">commercial version</a> is also promoted through the free plugin that is hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tell me, UpdraftPlus, how I&#8217;m supposed to continue trusting your company with my clients&#8217; backups when you use these deceptive and fraudulent practices?&#8221; one customer Adam Lowe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamslowe/status/1564325514319466503\">said</a> in response to Varghese&#8217;s discovery of the plugin not loading JS for performance tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow, all I can say is what an utter disappointment,&#8221; WordPress agency owner and developer Brian Jackson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of alleged deception is eerily similar to a <a href=\"https://metacoffeedata.com/manipulating-google-lighthouse-results-scam-by-upwork-freelancer/\">scam</a> reported by someone who contracted a performance freelancer on Upwork who artificially manipulated Google Pagespeed results. Others participating in the discussion on Twitter compared it to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Volkswagon emissions scandal</a> where the carmaker was found to activate its emissions controls only during laboratory testing in order to meet the EPA&#8217;s requirements after a violation. The vehicles on the road emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides while driving, as compared to how they performed in the rigged laboratory tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese and several other participants in the conversation concluded that this is why site owners should focus on what real world users are experiencing, instead of performance tool test scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hopefully they wonder why their CrUX report data (or better, RUM data) didn\'t budge.

If true, this is as short sighted as it is inexcusable,&#8221; UpdraftPlus customer Johnathon William <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnofhousejohn/status/1563216460737966080\">said</a>. &#8220;And it makes me wonder if I can trust their other product, UpdraftPlus, which I use to backup several client sites.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I contacted UpdraftPlus and lead developer David Anderson said the company was not aware of the issue with the code but related some of the backstory. UpdraftPlus was briefly in talks with the author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/\">Fast Velocity Minify</a> plugin about the possibility of combining forces, in which he would maintain the minification module within WP-Optimize and gain more users. Ultimately they could not come to an agreement, but during that time WP-Optimize&#8217;s developers forked and adapted Fast Velocity Minify under the GPL. The developers who worked on that adaption are no longer with the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the commit to our own source repository, 2.5 years ago (Jan 2020), the commit was labelled &#8216;Resolve &#8216;Add CSS and JS Minification GPL code from &#8216;Fast Velocity Minify&#8217; &#8211; Part 6&#8242;,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Part of a series of initial merges of code that was re-factored to be cleaner and use our coding style preferences (but not change any functionality). So the apparent intention of the merge of those lines was to bring over refactored code without at that stage making any changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;According to the commit history (i.e. the &#8216;git blame&#8217; function) no changes have been made to that code since, i.e. it is as-imported. (The history for WP Optimize is public in WordPress SVN too).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a cursory examination of the code, Anderson concluded that his team may need to reexamine it, as they were not aware of what was added two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I try to trace that function through the code within the plugins, the intention&nbsp;<strong>on the face of it</strong>&nbsp;appears to be that if the website visitor is a &#8216;bot,&#8217; then code that is pointless for bots won&#8217;t be carried out,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However having said that, 1) the bot names look to be heavily obfuscated/redacted, which is strange (why?), and&nbsp; 2) there are plenty of more obvious bots that aren&#8217;t listed there, such as the Googlebot itself. If that function was being put before me for review today, I&#8217;d certainly question why that is so. I can&#8217;t mind-read myself back 32 months ago, but, I remember it as being a long series of large patches, so it wasn&#8217;t being closely analysed on a line-by-line basis. We knew that we had identified FVM as a good plugin and our main focus was on adapting it to our structure and style, and those were the things I personally was looking at as the final reviewer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, UpdraftPlus&#8217; development team was not aware of this code until the Twitter thread was published over the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad to have it brought to our intention,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The associated code comment on a related fragment in its original source that it&#8217;s intended to prevent unnecessary requests for bots, but on a closer examination than that line got at the time, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll want to look at, as it does look questionable/strange, and we&#8217;ll be doing that by assigning it to a team member who&#8217;s our expert in JavaScript optimizations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anderson also said that if the JavaScript optimization experts cannot find any legitimate purpose for the code, &#8220;it will certainly be removed,&#8221; with a clear and unambiguous disclosure for the reasoning behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, UpdraftPlus has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/code-under-investigate-in-wp-optimize/#utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_content=social\">published a notice</a> in the plugin&#8217;s support forum to inform users that the code is currently under investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To be clear and set users’ minds at rest: the code in question is not dangerous, a virus, an infection, useful to hackers, or anything of that kind,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The allegation is that its only purpose in existing is effectively to cheat on speed tests. Such code, if so, does not belong in WP Optimize and we will remove it with a new release. Our products’ integrity, and our customers’ trust, are essential for us (and deliberately putting things in open source code that compromises that is, frankly, a stupid thing to do).&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 23:15:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Sonic Sphere and Empyrean Gate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=60315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://ma.tt/2022/08/sonic-sphere-and-empyrean-gate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1266:\"<p>If I had to pick one reason why I&#8217;d suggest every person should attend Burning Man at least once, it would be the art.

For example, the header uses the Cover block featuring a gradient image with the focal point picker set at a certain point. Site identity and navigation are organized within a group, followed by a Media and Text block header section. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon install and activation, Pentatonic delivers a good experience for users. Clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes users to the Site Editor with the front page loaded, looking nearly identical to the demo for the <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-free/\">free version</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic comes with 17 block patterns that users can easily mix and match to create their own unique pages. These include patterns for About Us, Call to Action, Featured Content, Sidebar, Music Podcasts, 404 Header, Archive header, Default footer, Footer with three columns, Default header, Recent with blog sidebar, Post header, Header with buttons, and more. Each section on the homepage can be recreated using a pattern on other pages or repeated/rearranged on the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes 11 templates and eight template parts, allowing users to make customizations to the 404 page, blog single posts, search results, post content, and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pro version of the theme includes access to custom blocks, such as a playlist, case study, skills bar, masonry, popup video, and more. The <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-pro/\">demo for the pro version</a> has a sticky music player at the bottom of the page, promotional popup video, podcast playlist, and other custom media additions that bands and artists may require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic has been optimized to respond well to all screen sizes and looks just as good on mobile as it does on desktop. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pentatonic/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> where you can preview all the patterns and check out a preview of the whole theme in action that strongly resembles the demo hosted on Catch Themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:38:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: Tech Roundup for the Week of August 22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/tech-roundup-for-the-week-of-august-22/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5489:\"<div class=\"wp-container-7 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">DigitalOcean\'s acquisition of Cloudways • Stop saying &#8220;Gutenberg!&#8221; • Build Mode Live with Brian Gardner and Sam Munoz • One week left to submit a style variation for TT3 • Cool Tool of the Week: Munir Kamal\'s Editor Plus </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-development-around-the-web\">WordPress Development Around the Web</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A glimpse of what’s going on in the world of development and design in the WordPress space.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/digitalocean-to-buy-web-hosting-firm-cloudways-for-350-million\">Huge news in the hosting space</a>! <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> is set to acquire <strong>Cloudways</strong> for $350 million (USD).

We need to have a consistent vocabulary on how we talk about these things to each other and to stakeholders so we all understand what we’re discussing. I’ve gotten into the habit of saying “the Block Editor” when talking about the new interface for page building in core, but I never thought that we could also break down explaining the various parts to full site editing as well. Human Made does a good job of clarifying all of this, and it might even be a great addition to the WordPress documentation to have all these defined right up front somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of hosting companies, Post Status members <strong>Sam Munoz</strong> and <strong>Brian Gardner</strong> from <strong>WPEngine</strong> have started <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/build-mode-live-july-2022-sessions/\">a regular Zoom meeting</a> called <strong>Build Mode Live</strong> to help anyone with their questions and struggles around full site editing, the block editor, WordPress, and how it all impacts business owners. They’re bringing a design, development, builder, and business owner perspective to an area where we haven’t seen much open discussion. <a href=\"https://calendly.com/bgardner-wpe/build-mode?month=2022-09\">You can sign up to participate right now</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the <strong>Make WordPress Design</strong> blog <strong>Channing Ritter</strong>, Design Director at <strong>Automattic</strong>, shared a reminder that there is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/24/tt3-default-theme-one-week-left-to-submit-style-variations/\">one week left to submit a variation to be included in the new Twenty Twenty Three theme</a> (TT3).

The plugin is led by serial developer <strong>Munir Kamal</strong>, who also runs <strong>Editors Kit</strong> and <strong>Gutenberg Hub</strong>.

This is a radical improvement over the current experience, which feels like walking into a room with all the lights on and multiple features competing for attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The combination of the site frame (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">Browse mode</a>) and one-click editing helps to obfuscate some of the aforementioned confusion around template editing,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;Now you simply browse to the page you want to update, and click ‘Edit’.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another idea Koster explored is a view that makes it easier to understand the interaction of styles and templates. The UI is much cleaner and drastically reduces the cognitive load for users who are struggling to grasp the concept of templates in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity and homepage configuration options haven&#8217;t found a place in the site editor yet. Koster proposed bringing them into the editor in a similar fashion to how it was previously presented in the Customizer, with live previews.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Koster also proposes organizing features like templates, template parts, reusable blocks, and patterns in a &#8220;Design Library&#8221; section, presented via a grid of thumbnails that would open the edit view. This would bring a new level of organization to a set of tools that are currently scattered throughout the site editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few highlights from his explorations. Although Koster articulates many of the Site Editor&#8217;s current pain points, his designs present an elegant solution for each. Check out the <a href=\"https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/\">full post</a> to see all the videos and other ideas for organizing features in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disparity between the current experience and Koster&#8217;s mockups is like a night and day Cinderella style transformation. It&#8217;s a powerful example of how thoughtful design can really solve problems. His explorations received positive feedback from those eager to see these designs implemented in Gutenberg. Koster said his next step is to prepare some simpler prototypes for collaboration on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ideas are still formative, but with some pruning we can get things into a shippable state,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;My next step is to refine and prototype a more stripped-back version, and take that to GitHub for wider thoughts and feedback.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:13:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Post Status: A Taxonomy of Access Control\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106756\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://poststatus.com/a-taxonomy-of-access-control/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2978:\"<p><strong>Bruce Schneier </strong><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html#comments\">thinks this idea</a> from <strong>Ittay Eyal</strong> is brilliant and broadly applicable. Since I like pretty much everything Bruce says (that I can understand) I tried to get my head around this and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">the discussion it spawned</a> in <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Post Status Slack</a> with <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Rowley</a> and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">JJJ</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bruce\'s summary:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The paper is about cryptocurrency wallet design, but the ideas are more general. Ittay points out that a key—or an account, or anything similar—can be in one of four states:<br /><br /><strong>safe</strong> Only the user has access,<br /><strong>loss</strong> No one has access,<br /><strong>leak</strong> Both the user and the adversary have access, or<br /><strong>theft</strong> Only the adversary has access.</p><p>Once you know these states, you can assign probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (someone hacks your account and locks you out, you forgot your own password, etc.) and then build optimal security and reliability to deal with it. It’s a truly elegant way of conceptualizing the problem.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of it more like this, since it\'s how most people actually operate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Secure:</strong> Only I have access (as far as I know)<ul><li><strong>Strong Secure:</strong> Proper strong, unique passwords, 2FA</li><li><strong>Weak Secure:</strong> Weak, reused passwords, no 2FA (OK for trivial sites that require a login, bad for your bank account.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Loss:/Lockout</strong> No one has access</li><li><strong>Shared:</strong> I and designated others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Leak:</strong> Undesignated, unknown others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Theft/Breach</strong>: An adversary has access <ul><li><strong>Theft and Lockout:</strong> An adversary has access and may have broadly leaked or shared access with others, but I am locked out.</li><li><strong>Theft and No Lockout:</strong> My account has been hacked but I can still get in. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid Sharing/Leaking with strong secure accounts, and the probability of theft/breach is much, much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html\">A Taxonomy of Access Control</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 14:42:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: Woo Stories, They are Everywhere\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-stories-they-are-everywhere/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:383:\"<p>Every product or site WooCommerce builder has a story to tell whether they are a developer, designer or anything between. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

Giving, making, creating&#8230; Looking at the search results for  &#8220;Make WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;the firehose&#8221; of Make WordPress Slack where the #docs channel was having their weekly meeting, Dan and Ny look at the wide range of options there are for new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, that\'s a step deeper in.</em></p><cite>Dan Knauss</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring and organizing Meetups is a topic that comes up again. That\'s where Ny feels she has been given the most and most enjoys giving back. However, there are barriers to getting people engaged with the WordPress project — and to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan asks what needs to be done to reach younger people. Ny talks about the barriers from a BIPOC perspective, where sensitivity to history and personal stories matters. Dan relates that to an inner city gardening project he volunteered with that had an all-white leadership team. If contributing is a privilege, how can we help elevate more people to that level of privilege?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also covered:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How does the older open source culture of contribution (not) translate to the contemporary culture of the &#8220;creator economy?&#8221;</li><li>Dan\'s initial experience with trying to onboard himself in #docs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"Cloudways\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-8 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"sponsor-wpengine\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/cloudways\">Cloudways</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Cloudways</strong> </strong>is proud to sponsor Post Status.

What comes to mind when, when you hear that word in the [00:01:00] WordPress context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, I guess, uh, the same it\'s, it\'s the same when I hear it in like, you know, outside in life contribution means giving back. It means helping, it means providing, um, and, uh, you know, it\'s the same in WordPress. So definitely down to talk about this today, and I\'m very interested to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s the core part of the, the project that is the oldest, um, feature of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oldest foundations of it, that\'s very, very open source, very old, um, old part of open. As Matt has said in, in some talks, like give a penny, take a penny kind of, kind of ethic. Um, really kind of going back, I guess, to like Linux and the seventies [00:02:00] and early and earlier generation. And I wonder sometimes if like after millennials or so if, if that\'s things have changed a lot and that\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understood. There\'s kind of a, a reciprocity there. You use the software, it\'s free. It\'s open. Um, how are, how can you, the more you get engaged with it as a user, as a developer, um, someone maybe profiting from it. How, how do you give back and does that, does that just happen naturally through the relationships that arise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or not. And how do we move really? How do we move the, the project forward? And, um, I was just looking this morning. Like if you, if you, um, I was, I was just Googling make WordPress. So there\'s the whole make.wordpress.org, um, page where you get the list of all the core core teams and, um, [00:03:00] If you search for make WordPress, you get three ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, first for WP engines, WordPress page builder, wordpress.com WordPress page builder element, or for WordPress, create it with Elementor, um, the create and build language. So, uh, most people these days, um, and, and they\'re targeting what people wanna do. Uh, how do you just make something with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create and build. But I\'m looking for the old school. How do I contribute back? Where, where the you\'re budding developer designer, just helping, like helping out. We\'re always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Um, and there, what you can give back goes into all these teams that, uh, we now have a performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn\'t changed a ton. It\'s, it\'s rare for them to add. So we got the core and that\'s really like the fundamental. Thing here, if we don\'t move word breast core [00:04:00] forward, how much does anything else matter? But there\'s so much else people can give and do that really is essential too. You don\'t don\'t want to deemphasize that design mobile mobile team is now been more explicitly defined as that\'s open source that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not, um, that\'s not something that is tied to jet pack or.com. And you, you wanna work on iOS and Android apps, Java objective C swift. Um, that\'s a, that\'s a whole nother section accessibility. Polyglots multilingual, uh, translation, WordPress support, uh, support forums. What,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, what stands out to you the most out of all of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what do you think? Like, not what\'s most important, but, um, cuz that\'s subjective. Um, which one would you be like most interested in contributing to? Yeah. Which one do you think speaks to you the most? When you read through the list? [00:05:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I was, I was, I\'ve been thinking about that. So then there\'s documentation and that\'s where I\'ve been trying to kind of learn, figure out how to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s kind of where it, it isn\'t that easy. It isn\'t that easy. maybe, you know, some people or if you have a deeper connection, but from that straight outside in it\'s it\'s tricky documentation, themes, plugins, community. Training test TV marketing, CLI WordPress CLI the VP CLI uh, hosting tide, open verse photos for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s really a lot of different skill sets that could be attractive. And a lot of things you could do, but to be honest, the, um, my, my experience is, um, I haven\'t really done like. Contribution in the form of little patches and bug reports and stuff since way back, like, you know, they\'re still using tra have you, do you have much SVN experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s what we were all using like 20 years [00:06:00] ago on source project. WordPress is still using. Um, so, so yeah, there\'s all these, all these different teams that are maybe attractive to different skill sets you may have or different people, um, May have, and, um, core is really at the center of it. And there\'s all, all these other things orbiting around that, um, or orbiting around the community and, and serving it or around mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, finding your way into it, I think is, is. Is the trick. Um, once someone gets interested in, in doing that and bringing, bringing new folks in and smoothing the onboarding, um, is probably, um, something we need to pay more attention to. It\'s tough. I, Brian mm-hmm Brian cords was, was writing about [00:07:00] that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did he, um, So he, he talks about his experience. I\'m, I\'m kind of doing the same thing. Try, can I put in a few hours a week, I\'ve been trying to follow, just look at the docs program, you know, cause writing, editing that\'s mm-hmm, , that\'s probably the easiest thing for me. I\'ve I\'ve done little bug reports and patches and, and things before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go back a long way. So SVN or, you know, was something I was using way before GitHub existed get was a thing. Um, but it\'s, it\'s. It\'s quite amazed of, of things and a lot of customs and etiquettes and rituals, parts of the culture to, to understand, um, to get started. So I feel like there\'s like a long watching, reading, learning, asking questions, maybe getting mentored, um, phase you have to go through, um, have you taken a look at like the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would make [00:08:00] WordPress slack at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. And I\'m going to be completely honest. Um, I will eventually, I am just in so many slack channels right now. I don\'t think I can. I don\'t think I can possibly take on that one. Um, I\'ve heard it\'s it\'s a lot. I, I just cannot do it. I\'m in like work slacks. I have like my mentoring slacks that I do official mentoring with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have like slacks I was in before I, um, got. Um, tech and I still help people there. I just, uh, if I join one more, I think my head will explode. Yeah. But please enlighten me to what usually goes on</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> here. Well, I\'m not an expert, I\'m trying to figure out the same as you and, and, and Brian and, um, yeah, I think the reality is, is yet they call it the fire hose for reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s probably, one of the busiest slacks and consistently for so long, this major, um, Of [00:09:00] information and cooperation. Um, so it\'s daunting, it\'s intimidating to, um, to look at how to get into, um, but it there\'s there\'s method to the madness and what I\'ve learned, just kind of following along and looking at, at things in a, in a pretty traditional way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I assume the. Other teams work like this, but like docs. Um, we have a, um, a meeting every Tuesday morning at this time. So 8, 8, 8 am. I\'m kind of following, um, on my phone here and people kind of check in. I can make it, I can\'t make it. Um, melanic cap is, um, one, the leader there and one of the leaders and you\'d probably like her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a ump developer. Um, who\'s kind an advocate. For PHP as well. Who\'s been doing docs for a long time. So you developer literacy is really important if you\'re gonna write [00:10:00] docs and guides for, for things that directly deal with that. But there\'s so much else you don\'t have to be. You don\'t have to have any particular code depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much other documentation going on. Um, and that\'s probably starting to overlap some with the training materials that are another team. That\'s a. Newer thing that will help onboard people, I think, to have training and then also mentoring happening all these meetups that are relatively new, um, community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Is that I\'m not sure what group that\'s what if that\'s happening under the community team? I think that\'s all that\'s under the training team. Mm-hmm uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> what the meetups,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> oh, that you\'re talking about. Yeah. They\'re make they\'re they\'re coming out of the core. So they\'re, there are, um, Hannah tab. For this somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Organizing the meetups, which is what I\'m doing in [00:11:00] Columbia, South Carolina. And I always say the city and not the state and Charlotte, North Carolina, mm-hmm um, falls more under community. We\'ve been all over there. Yeah. Trying to get things, uh, settled for it. Um, that\'s that\'s my area of export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expertise, but it\'s still really, really hard. Um, , I I\'ve, I\'ve organized a lot of things and this might be the hardest honestly. And I don\'t know if, if it\'s, you know, because it\'s so specialized or what, but, um, still really excited. And I just I\'m, I just can\'t wait to, you know, have that set up as my contribution and like spread it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s like my goal for it. Yeah. That</p>\n\n\n\n<p>would</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Def that would be under, under community. Um, Yeah, it\'s actually is I guess, something you could get into and start doing in your own, um, in your own city and a lot happens outside of slack, outside of, um, Outside of this, but that there\'s the community team. And mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, I was speaking of, um, the, the newer meetups that [00:12:00] are sponsored by learn, um, WordPress. So there\'s, there\'s probably some increasing overlap between community and training, which is a good thing. There, there are all these meetups that are happening as virtual. Um, there\'s a schedule, there\'s a calendar on here where people like, um, um, People who are directly involved in working on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, uh, Nick Diego, I saw I had had one coming up, um, uh, will be doing live workshops so you can go and get, get some knowledge from, from people who are directly working on, um, on newer parts of, of WordPress and. so some of that is higher, higher level stuff for, um, developers, designers, and some of it is oriented towards people who might be really new to using WordPress in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So training\'s [00:13:00] close to mentoring and close to community building. So that\'s kind of a neat area where, um, where people can. Brought in and, um, connected. And I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, , that\'s like step in mm-hmm um, for a lot of people, um, I noticed that, so we have this weekly thing that Daniel Chut Smith is doing, um, for us where he\'s rounding up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, What\'s going on and what\'s catching his eye, uh, design and development. And this, his last Roundup was mostly stuff coming from.org from make, create your first app with Gutenberg data. So using react. Um, so Adams Linsky put together a nice tutorial. That\'s showing you how to do that. That\'s a link to, um, developer, the developer section of word, wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme builders, Figma [00:14:00] of building a workflow from Figma Figma to your block theme. You\'re trying to create, that\'s a learn WordPress online workshop. So that\'s, that\'s one of these things I\'m talking about. That\'s a meet up. So, um, you can sign up and, and do that. There that\'s an intermediate level for an audience of builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people who may not be high, um, Deep into code, um, high level development stuff. That\'s okay. This is, um, working from Figma to your block template. Are you, are you doing anything, any front end stuff like that, or mostly have these database backend projects you\'re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m doing everything. But, um, mostly right now I am working with the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mostly when I talk to my mentors and they want me to show them, like, I always get the question. Uh, can you show me what you do at work or a day in the life of you? Mm-hmm and, um, I don\'t show them my [00:15:00] calendar. I don\'t wanna scare them away, but, um, uh, usually it\'s front end work with them, um, because that\'s what, you know, they learn first and most are interested in, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, I have not gotten away from front end work because that\'s the first thing that newbies wanna see. Oh yeah. How it works in WordPress. And I think, uh, WordPress is great for front end development. So that\'s my way of trying to get them into the community as well. So I throw in my community stuff like, Hey, you know, we\'re gonna have meet up soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to come and learn more about the community and that\'s my sales pitch. And that\'s how I, that\'s how I get. That\'s how I\'m getting people into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s great to see that there\'s so many levels like, yeah, we\'re gonna reach out to builders, to people who are totally new to it, to people are maybe doing freelance or agency work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I was hinting earlier, like when you, if you search for this, like the way that, the way that a lot of companies, including, um, wordpress.com and automatic or. [00:16:00] Presenting WordPress to the world is to the creator economy and to, to people, I just wanna build something. I wanna start my business online. I, and, and their first thought is I don\'t not to understand anything about open source or that there\'s a community behind that or what, that, that, there\'s this, uh, culture of contribution and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a long, that\'s a long way up later. Mm-hmm and , I wrote something where I, I, I feel like, you know, we really have. Embrace that. And I see that happening on the marketing level, on the commercial side to a lot of WordPress companies. Um, and I, I even noticed like, as, as the.com, um, I, when they did their first price change, I got the bargain and I up upgraded my longstanding account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a.blog blog and a bunch of other sites there. And. Um, you can, there\'s the marketplace there. You can install and do a lot in.com. Now you can install Elementor I\'ve not seen that [00:17:00] before. So you could, you could pop that in on wordpress.com and start building with that if you want. And they\'re very oriented towards a, a builder, um, creator economy approach, but getting people inside is like the key thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, however you come, however you come, come, as you are. I think like that needs to be more of. Our approach. And as cuz people aren\'t gonna, the average person, isn\'t gonna go to.org, the make thing there, and look at these core teams and, and, and go like, okay. Yeah. I, I see where I fit. Like I, you and I would, would struggle with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s gonna, it\'s gonna take weeks and, and months to probably get, um, to get comfortable. And that\'s, that\'s cool. That\'s fine. That\'s how you build relationships, but it\'s not. It\'s not like on the instant gratification level of, let me build my site today, which you wanna do as quickly as as you can. Um, [00:18:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think it\'s even, um, even for people like me who will sit down and take their time, um, when things are presented to them, It\'s so much to go through sometimes depending on what you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like you said, like it\'s not an easy thing to jump into. It\'s it\'s making that time too. I know, like for me right now, I get asked every week, like, how are you doing everything you do? And sometimes, I don\'t know, but, um, like. I think it\'s easier for me to still contribute because like, I, I didn\'t go into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, Hey, I have to make myself fit to one of these. I went into this as, this is what I already do. This is something I\'m good at, how can I connect this with WordPress? So I think that\'s an easier way. And then like that allowed me to like, okay, I can make time to, you know, set this. I have a partner helping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Ken, yeah. Elliot is helping, um, well, he\'s the mastermind. I\'m helping him. Um, and, um, I think that\'s a easier way, but I agree with you a hundred percent. [00:19:00] Um, that\'s, you know, just when you were reading them off, I\'m like, this is a lot. And then when you get into them, it\'s like, you have to break it down and that\'s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if we have like more. I guess people like me or you cuz you did it too. When you talked about how, you know, you\'re a writer and documentation probably would be your strongest point and you\'ve done some of it before. I think people getting people like us to talk to people and say, well, this is how we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would definitely help people a lot because it\'s a little overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it is. And yeah. Well, if what I, what I found is that it\'s probably your own sense of, um, my own sense of in, in, uh, you don\'t want to be ask of the dumb question, but, or, you know, You have to put yourself out there. So they\'re very encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like who\'s got questions who needs help. You know, you, you, people will take the time and, and show you. And I\'ve, I\'ve got like an accumulated list of tabs and, and links where I need to, I need to take some time and watch this UN WordPress TV. Right. I need to read through this and figure it out. [00:20:00] I, um, a couple weeks ago, I, you know, figured out how they\'re using good Gutenberg on, um, GitHub, a little deeper and, and how to, um, How to submit, um, changes on, uh, there\'s there\'s documentation, that\'s written into code, uh, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and sometimes it\'s wrong or, or changes. So you have to, you have to actually commit, um, changes to comments that are embedded in PHP code somewhere. Um, Things like that there\'s a wide range of, of stuff, but how all these workflows and things work and it just takes some time to, to learn. And it\'s, it\'s pretty satisfying once you figure it out and you are like, okay, I fixed, I fixed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is. Yeah. And in the process you might find some more bugs or things and stuff like that to, to put in. Um, but just a little here and there is, is, um, is really a good thing. [00:21:00] Um, I, I. People on the whole are, are really welcoming. It is, it is just getting past that fire hose and here, here\'s what I need to forget all that other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what I need to focus on. And it\'s probably cool doing the meetups or mentoring, which, um, is gonna become more and more a part of the training and community. I, um, I don\'t have, I\'d like to get more details on this, but I, I see SFA has been, been saying things about mentoring as. Becoming a more explicit form of contribution, mentoring, how to do word camps and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm , and that they, there is probably some mentoring program coming down the line, along with training. So if you\'re doing, you want to go and do, um, a meetup, um, tutorial of some kind or do that in the context of your own meetups, totally contributing. And then I that\'s, that\'s probably accessible to a lot of people cuz most of the work is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gonna be, I would assume relationships and [00:22:00] stuff like in your community. So you don\'t like, you don\'t start from slack, you don\'t start from, from all that. That\'s kind of where you go to maybe get support. And, um, the main, the main thing is really the people stuff. So if that\'s, that\'s what turns you on and, and motivates you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, that\'s totally essential contributing out there in. Real life relationships, um, locally where you\'re, you\'re starting. How\'s that going with? Um, Greenville and, um, or green wait, Greensboro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> no, not Greenville. Um, not Greensboro. Um, I think you\'re, you\'re getting me nice or green mixed up with those I\'m I\'m joking. Um, so char Charlotte and Columbia. Okay. I don\'t know where Columbia .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Go ahead. Sorry. I used Greenville in my head like Greenville, South Carolina, you know, I used to live [00:23:00] in Raleigh mm-hmm Durham, chapel hill area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually. I don\'t know if you know that area that well, Carrie and Carrie and table mm-hmm . Yeah. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I, I really love that area actually. Um, uh, you, uh, now there was a, uh, Greenville, uh, WordPress meetup for a long time. Um, and I think like a lot of people in Columbia, even though there was one in Columbia at one point, I think a lot of people in Columbia had to go to Greenville for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may be thinking about that. Cuz Greenville, I think had a longer, a one that lasted longer than ours. In Columbia. Um, but we\'re right now, if we were to start one in Columbia, to my knowledge, cuz I always check out Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, the big major cities, to my knowledge, we would be the only one in the state right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna double check on that. But the last I checked a few months ago. Yeah, we would be the only one. So I. It definitely would help. And like, we really want to spread the knowledge because Columbia\'s in the, in the middle of the state. Right. That\'s why I chose Columbia, not just because I [00:24:00] was from there, but it\'s in the middle of the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm, , we\'re an hour and a half to almost anywhere in the state, maybe two max. And so if people have to make that drive, which, you know, if they can, that\'s fine. If they can, we still wanna do it, uh, in a way that will. You know, semi virtual and recording recorded. So we\'re setting that up as well. Um, cuz we know South Carolina is very rural and we don\'t have great public transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, it\'s really going to help a lot because it\'s going to reach all throughout our state, which is not known for tech at all, Charleston and Greenville, more Southern Columbia. So. It\'s going to help a lot and it\'s going really, really well. Um, we have a place, um, we have food, uh, so many different companies reached out to me because they saw what I was doing and wanted to help goad wants to feed us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, my company master WP wants to feed us and master WP is actually sponsoring our, um, sponsoring us and taking care of our venue. Um, we [00:25:00] have people offering to send us. Things to give out to newbies. Um, I have Courtney Robertson, which is, she\'s been such a great help who has just offered to give out so many learning materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, I ju just the outpouring of support and then we can take that and spread it. It\'s just been, it\'s been a community effort, so it definitely meetups are definitely community. I see why it\'s under that label and I\'m just so excited. Like I\'m going to like spam everyone\'s Twitter when. You know, get up and running and we have pictures and video and things like that because, um, I think, you know, I agree with Josepha Josepha is really, really great to talk to, and I love how she answers questions and it\'s always very transparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it\'s, it\'s awesome that she\'s going to expand that because we can definitely take these materials and, you know, help with that and make sure people can do it in their states. Maybe their states don\'t have any work camp meetups or WordPress meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There\'s probably, uh, It\'d be interesting to look at a, a Pinboard, you know, [00:26:00] map of, you know, where we, where there\'s activity and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are very established and been around a long time. Some come and go. The, I know the local Edmonton one. Um, yeah, pretty much ended just around the time I, I moved here. There\'s one in there\'s, one in Calgary. Um, and I\'ve talked with some people there about, about all that. Um, you know, it, it\'s a, it\'s a takes a lot to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get things, uh, rolling again, but there\'s wherever you go, there\'s kind of an existing WordPress builder community. I, I, I sense there\'s a lot of people freelancing or, and there\'s a bunch of agencies and my, this was true even when, before WordPress was that adopted probably at that level. And I was doing more with, um, with June law and some other DRAL and other, other CMS, um, related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That a lot of people just get in to scratch their rich and build something. And, and then they [00:27:00] start doing that as a job and maybe they develop an agency or something. And so there\'s, there\'s a bunch of people who are like an unorganized, the lump and proletariat of word press, who are like, uh, they\'re not organized into, um, into a, a regular meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Um, but the potential is there mm-hmm , maybe it comes in and goes at at times, cuz there there\'re people who would fit the kind of WordPress professional or the line between the hazy line amateur and, and professional and doing this for myself and or which often turns into this is my job. Um, but it\'s, it\'s often secondary and I think that\'s an, that\'s been tough for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project. And I wonder if there\'s, if there\'s a, that\'s kind of where contributor language gets gets complicated. And I wonder if we should like focus more on creativity and creation and there\'s all these people who are sort of [00:28:00] on the outer edges, who, who are very versed, inward press or using it in some significant way, but they haven\'t really connected deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the community. And they\'re definitely contributing in the sense of, um, teaching and informing and expanding the market and expanding the brand, but, um, how they find their way into. These other, um, layers of the onion towards core contribution. Um, it\'s, it\'s tough cause you don\'t wanna make it sound like, well, what you\'re doing isn\'t worth as much mm-hmm um, cause it it\'s as they\'re all different, but to drive things forward, you do need people to come in who get more of that kinda leadership level to organize, meet up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentor people, um, submit patches, um, get involved in, [00:29:00] in actual software development, which yeah. Is hard not to, not to privilege. Cause that\'s really a key, that\'s what we\'re all using. That\'s what either falls behind or, or innovates and yeah. What do, what do you think about that? Do you, are you think there\'s ways in our language that can be kind of offputting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s like this inner circle of, of people who give back and are. Are you adequate is it can maybe be an easy feeling of, uh, of inadequacy or imposter syndrome that\'s RI and, and things, and, and that language can kinda land heavily on, on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, especially, you know, that\'s something that goes beyond tech, but, um, when we\'re talking specifically about us right here. Yeah. That can be off putting you. You have to think. Um, I do a lot of community service. because that\'s just how I am. That\'s just how I was raised. That\'s just me as a person, but I\'m smart enough also to acknowledge [00:30:00] it\'s tough to get people to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it\'s tough. Um, that\'s something that\'s drilled that was drilled into my head from, um, From a young age. And we talked a little bit about that on one of our other podcasts, like how American slavery, like is affecting people to this day. And it\'s like, there\'s no way anybody in my family from the oldest members, my great aunts to the youngest, my little baby niece, none of them would just sit and smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I told them I was working, doing anything for free outside of C. Help. So , and it\'s like, it doesn\'t even have to be that deep for a lot of people. People are just not working for free mm-hmm, , we\'re in a very capitalist society. Um, we, things cost money. You know, things are high right now. Um, but again, not even getting that deep, it\'s just hard for some people to just work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also for people who want to do it time. Time is such a big constraint. So you may have people that are out there. They\'re like, I wanna do this. Yeah. But I [00:31:00] don\'t know how I wanna do this. And I don\'t have the time. And now these people are telling me that I\'m not enough. If I\'m not doing this, man, I\'m not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I see how it can lead there. Um, I, I, I definitely see that. Um, sometimes, you know, I, I it\'s, it, it is, it does seem like that at times, but it\'s just going to depend on you as a person, like stuff like that. Won\'t bother me personally, because if I can\'t do something, I can\'t do it. Yeah. I don\'t have the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t have the time, but I, I get it. I definitely get it. Um, I, I\'m not sure though how. I\'m not sure how to pull people in, who may be feeling that like it, they may have that imposter syndrome now. Um, is there just like extra reassurance? What do you think? What, what do you think could be clarified in the language to get those, to, to kind of pull those people back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the more channels, the more way, ways in the, the better off you are, if it, I feel like in the past, it\'s [00:32:00] like, that\'s the only thing, like.org make page. You either figure out how to get into a team here, you hit the support forum. You, you, you find you come in through some local group. Um, there are only a couple, couple ways to do it and it, uh, it is all in this open source contribution code, committing focus, and that\'s become less and less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was alwa that\'s always, always been a subculture and it\'s become probably more and more of one. um, I think younger generations too, are in a totally different space in because it\'s social, um, realities, like, I don\'t know how much we\'ve really addressed that. I mean, there are long term prolonged economic contraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, not everyone\'s doing that. Mm-hmm well, emotionally. With stable income and employment. Mm-hmm [00:33:00] you can\'t assume stuff like that there, it we\'ve been through the most stressful. Yeah. I, I don\'t know if we\'re really through it, you know, like you turn on the news and it people all around the world. And even in, in places that are, are fairly affluent it\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more stress and tension in, in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people have lost, uh, friends and loved ones either, you know? They\'re no longer living. Um, that happens normally, but we just pandemic. Um, there\'s but there\'s so many, especially as you have a community to ages and, and goes along. I, I think a lot of us who\'ve been in there a long time. Um, there\'s time of life things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I, it would be more sensitive to that all. And, and what you\'re saying too about. there\'s cultural and, and definitely racial differences that I think are hard to see from the outside. You\'re making me think of, um, mm-hmm, how the, a [00:34:00] good metaphor for this is when I, one of the things I did, I did a ton of, I lived in a part of Milwaukee that was, um, and otherwise it\'s very second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe people would say an apartheid city that has some. Entrenched in difficult problems and living in one of really the only area that\'s, that\'s fairly mixed and, and diverse is volunteerism is a key thing there. And it\'s tough. People don\'t have necessarily have a bunch, but there\'s this huge. They don\'t necessarily have the means or whatever, but they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s just such a drive to do community projects together and fix stuff. And gardening became more and more community gardens and stuff like that. Victory gardens. Yeah. Well, when I first started doing that, I was, um, I was doing it with, uh, uh, a church that had an interesting history. And so we had mostly African American kids coming to the summer program and, and trying to make a.[00:35:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of vacant lots where stuff has been torn down or burned down over the years and in my neighborhood there. And, um, trying to build a, make a garden and, um, this same, it, it it\'s, it wasn\'t so much the work for free, cuz we, it was all hitched up to, um, You you come and you work on this, you get paid a certain kind of gift allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we like try to explain banking and like walk down the street to the, the local bank on Martin Luther king drive. And like, this is how money works and like save a little. And , uh, give a little back and, and think about what your long term plans are for what you want to get. It was, it was honestly very white, middle class kind of skiing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>very good in very good intentions, but the first barrier is, um, these are kids who have like zero, um, [00:36:00] there in that area. Um, Their, their experience is all urban for, um, probably one or two generations. But before that down the Mississippi deep south, not a good agricultural experience share, you know, share cropping, you know, extended forms of Neo slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, until grandparents, parents came up in the fifties, forties, fifties, and got the last of the good industrial jobs before that all went, went in part. Um, so, mm. I realized and read some things. Um, I never read something. I can\'t remember who it was, but there was a, there was a local guy and then someone else rare, uh, voices of African Americans who got on the land and were farming got, you know, as free farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people came all the way up here in Alberta and did that Canada. And it\'s not the typical voice. And they talked about how hard it is to do. [00:37:00] Things like with the land, from an African American perspective, cuz there\'s such an alienation from it some of the time. And so these kids, oh yeah, they would not wear, like they didn\'t have grungy clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would wear like their best white brand new shoes. Like, you know, they didn\'t want to get messed up. It was really hard to get people like, get your hands down in, in this. And then like, remember kids would say like, you all look like a bunch of slaves. Like this is a huge barrier. Here cuz there\'s not an ability to imagine us working and doing this free labor in any other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like who\'s in charge, the white guys like, like, yeah, it totally looks, it totally looks that way. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, yeah. Yeah. It that\'s a good, that is a good way to put that. Sorry, that that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really story. Cause you can express that in a way that is accusatory. and make, you know, make us feel really bad, but, um, but it\'s totally valid and, and [00:38:00] there was a disconnect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way I found around that was like individual relationships and getting like over a couple years and getting to know some of these kids is they were growing up and like they in doing other things with them, like I found a, a bunch of the young men, um, like they never went over to east side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s dangerous. You can\'t go over there and there\'s nothing there that we would be interested in and, you know, broadening people\'s sense of their own freedom and capacity. Yeah, you actually, we can go over here. There\'s some cool stuff and food you like and, um, people who, uh, are friendly. So it, I think that kind of everyone does that everyone has their little comfort zone that probably needs to be expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, those walls exist, cuz people have been hurt or they\'ve, um, or there\'s something in their history where they see this as a wall that is defended and is dangerous to push [00:39:00] or they, they sense on some level like this is gonna, um, this isn\'t what I should, this isn\'t for me, this isn\'t my people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just huge that\'s people stuff. We have to find, find ways to make many ways through and in. Um, cuz if you keep trying something that doesn\'t work, that turns people off, it doesn\'t matter how right. You think you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, you\'re right on the money with that. And. just relating that back to WordPress. Imagine those kids that you were, uh, you know, trying to get to do that with. And they\'re like, God, like not saying, this is their attitude, but say they walked away with that saying mm-hmm they were trying to get us to do free labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were trying to get us do free work. That\'s crazy. And then they. um, they, you know, they get older and they learn code and they learn tech. And they\'ve heard that tech is just this, this freedom and it\'s this place to make money. And it\'s just like, you can elevate, I can elevate my life and they get to tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing they see is people saying, Hey, if you wanna be a [00:40:00] great person in this community, you need to do some free work. They all like what? Like they might freak out like what in the world? Why is everybody want me to do free, free labor and, um, that\'s, you know, that\'s just relating that back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s it\'s sometimes that\'s. A red flag to people. It\'s definitely a red flag to me. Um, because also people are still exploiting people of color women. Um, people who are disabled, they are still getting exploited for low wages or free labor to this day. So that\'s still something we have to look out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve been asked to do free labor many times, and I\'ve had to politely tell people like, no, I\'m not doing that. Or, you know, and depending on. What the situation is, maybe talk to others, like what\'s going on. Like I have to teach my mentors not to accept like, well, this job, they really gonna gimme the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, okay, me an exposure and experience. And then one day I\'ll be a big developer. No. Do not let people do that to you. That\'s like, I, I always tell people like, no, [00:41:00] you, you deserve to be paid. Now you deserve to be paid fair and adequately. So we don\'t have to go back too far. It\'s happening today. Um, so of course people are calling it out more and people are looking at it as a red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate that people see it as a red flag in WordPress. Uh, some people. Inmate WordPress and giving back. And then I hate that some people just, you know, don\'t have the time and they\'re turned off by, you know, phrasing about it because it\'s, it\'s a privilege to have free time. Honestly, these days, isn\'t it, it\'s a privilege to be able to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I never forget. And that\'s, that\'s something I always tell people as well, like, you know, you don\'t have to. You don\'t have to thank me. Like people are always like, oh, thank you for this like that. I don\'t, you know, you don\'t have to thank me. I, I acknowledge that, you know, it\'s just a privilege for me to be able to do this for you and that throws some people off, but Hey, it knows what it is, but we, I don\'t know how to bridge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially as a, as a woman of color, who\'s been asked to do free things as a woman, as a woman of color, as a [00:42:00] person of color. I get it. I get it. I definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> get. I, I, I was really glad when I, I think it was Josepha my first contact with hearing someone say that it\'s a privilege to contribute. Um, and I hadn\'t really thought about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that does that\'s good language, I think, because it, it gives honor to that role and that capacity, but it also understands that that might not be. An individual is at, at that time, then I think you have to extend yourself and go further and, and look at who is underprivileged or who lacks these privileges and how can we raise them up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we open doors? Um, and that that\'s, what\'s cool about the mentoring and, and the community stuff. Cause I think that\'s, that\'s what it does, you know, get it will help. It will help. There are other ways to, to give back and. [00:43:00] And it\'s, it can take years it\'s years of relationships and, and growth where, um, that that\'s what\'s needed to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can\'t, you can\'t what we\'re saying here. You can\'t just treat people like cogs. Like they\'re not all in the same category. They\'re not the same time of life and they\'re not the same people. And when you really know, get to know them, um, they\'ve unique gifts and capacities and what they\'re okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. With doing. um, at the moment and it\'s okay for everyone to say, and they, they, they need to, like, I need to, I need to step back. I need, um, I think we\'ve been, there\'s been so much more, um, recognition of that. Um, mm-hmm , uh, someone was tweeting the other day of like, they\'re just too much coming at. \'em too much stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re gonna, they\'re gonna give their, um, word camp ticket to someone else. And. Step back from going there. And, um, and a lot of people are [00:44:00] really supportive of that. Like, yeah, it\'s tough. Uh, tough call maybe, but, um, it\'s okay to it\'s okay to say, you know, I I\'ve hit my limit here. Um, mm-hmm .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That. Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna backtrack. I think that that\'s a great way. That would be a, a big help to helping people letting them know it\'s okay. That needs to be more clear if you can\'t do this right now. It\'s okay. Like you said, like, you know, Joseph said it\'s a privilege and you know, letting these people know, like, um, that doesn\'t mean you\'re not privileged if you can\'t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that\'s just not your time and that\'s, and that\'s completely okay. Right. And I, I like that. I like that a lot. And I, I really like that. I think also another big thing. We need to get people to see the value mm-hmm and giving back. Because again, like what\'s the value. If I can\'t make money, if I have to like take time out of my life where I\'m missing with my family or my friends, what\'s the, what value do I have to, some people like, just knowing it\'s going to [00:45:00] improve the life of someone else is not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s okay though. It\'s okay. Um, but how do we get people to see the value in this? I think community seeing people like me, who, you know, I could not, I could stop giving back tomorrow and be okay and go do other things with my life. But I don\'t wanna do that. I like giving back. It\'s valuable to. . I have a lot of things I value about giving back, especially in this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I stand up there and I talk about it and I tell people and I give to them, honestly, I think that\'s the number one thing I\'ve seen in my life that makes other people wanna give. If they can see the value that other people are getting, that isn\'t tangible, nobody\'s handing me money to do any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so I think being a, a beacon of that helps, and I think I wish we had more people, but it\'s, it\'s hard if you\'re, if you\'re doing all of this and you\'re giving your time away, it\'s hard to be like, you know, the poster job for that as well. Um, right. We a lot of people have families. I don\'t know what I would do if I had children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I would probably just [00:46:00] scrap \'em to my chest. One of those little baby vests. I like those. Yeah. I used to do that in front of you. Yeah. Oh, I love those. I would just scrap \'em to my chest and like, I guess we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> around and talk. I\'m glad to be through that kind of, um, yeah, my, my younger two daughters are, um, on finishing high school now, so it\'s pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s on their own, but, uh, yeah, that was, that was tough. That was interesting. I was the home parent. Um, and at one point, yeah, they were like, mm-hmm um, four girls they were mostly there with me and yeah, the two close together. Um, yeah. It\'s uh, well freelancing and doing neighborhood projects. It, it was, um, it was a lot and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm it makes you, it makes you sensitive. the fact that you need to, you need to understand people in their context and so that, like you don\'t mm-hmm so you can kind of help on your end too. You don\'t ask too much or that, you know, you know, how to, [00:47:00] how to phrase, um, you know what they\'re, they\'re just some conditions like you understand like, oh, this is, isn\'t a good, this isn\'t a good time or a good person to, to ask to, to help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or. Or maybe they need, you know, just knowing what the needs are and where you can be supportive to. Um, yeah, just the, the more you get deeper into individual relationships, I think the stronger and more, um, sensitive like community is the, like those go together, the strong and sensitive . Cause you\'re, you\'re aware of each other as individuals and, um, that holds things nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that made me, I was one. The last thing I, I was thinking while you were saying that there, there are so many, I think there are so many things people do or don\'t do that. Some things need to not be done. that, that contribute so [00:48:00] much. And we know it and, and sometimes it there\'s other forms of recognition that are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like yeah. If the, if WordPress cord doesn\'t move forward, everything else fails. And there\'s like, there\'s a level. um, mm-hmm of focus and need on that, that that is is unique, but then there\'s stuff that\'s farfield from maybe any, any teams that is so important in the ecosystem. And, um, uh, a guy, everyone I think has nothing but prays for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin O Hashi who, um, who like Kevin O Hashi, who does the, um, uh, WordPress benchmarks? WooCommerce too. Have you ever looked at those? Uh, there\'s kind of neutral third party deep, um, uh, analysis each year of, um, performance on load testing and, and a bunch of other stuff of, of hosts. Who, who, um, partner with them who say like, yeah, here here\'s our, here\'s a free account [00:49:00] and all of our tiers test them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, never go through those and, and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have, um, I have, did I do last year? I have, I have, I I\'m like, I\'m just going back in my mind, but I have, and I think that is really, really, really awesome. That does that. I\'m so sorry. I hear</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> from people a lot about, about that. Like that\'s a, that\'s a major service because there there\'s a lot of data poverty in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your plugin isn\'t in the re.org repo, like what do we know? What, what, what do you, what do we know about that whole, um, part of the market? And if you are in it, it\'s very limited. What, what data you get out, um, hosting, you know, going way back has always been. A pretty murky place for are these real reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Jen . Oh man. So this is like the [00:50:00] one he\'s got the one, um, the one shining beacon of reliable, trustworthy stuff. And as, uh, And he, the contribution is largely in what he doesn\'t do, which is take money or sponsors in. Um, I, I forget what is, what the, what the revenue model there is, but this is, this is one guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this isn\'t some growth oper organization. Um, it, those are really difficult things. The things we need to subsidize or help that, um, are. Kind of have a regulatory effect that help protect the space and the commons, um, because they don\'t aim at massive growth and they aim at a giving you a really honest signal on, um, you know, how are, how are these hosts doing one, one compared to another, what do you get for this, [00:51:00] this price point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. They, um, it\'s good for them. They, they know where they stand and how they\'re, how they\'re doing. I\'m sure they have their own data, but it\'s a huge incentive to, um, to compete where we want them to . Um, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of different things like that. There\'s just certain personalities who give back a ton on, um, social media or in, um, their willingness to, to teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. Yeah, I don\'t know. Do we recognize that openly enough? Um, and I think people doing stuff for the love of it is a huge privilege and it really, it is really is gratifying when people say thank you. So, um, we should do that more and thank you for starting meetups. Interesting. coming on this, on this podcast and, and being a, um, a unique voice in the, in the C.[00:52:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Uh, you\'re so welcome. Thank you, Dan, for having me on here and agreeing to do a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> no, I didn\'t agree to that. depends on what it is, but yeah, I\'m looking, looking forward to meeting all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, you picked the song. We\'ll see. I don\'t know. It\'s pens. Who\'s watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ll give you a list. I\'ll give you a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> God love. Uh, yeah. I don\'t know nothing by Madonna. I remember bad memories of a friend at a, um, student union at Marquette university who, uh, crazy guy. I don\'t think he had even been drinking, but he did, um, Papa don\'t preach and acted it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, he ended up playing down on a table or something and yeah. Yeah. He was having a, having his baby. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh, now I gotta do [00:53:00] Madonna. I gotta show him up. okay. No Madonna just make me a list of no, the nose. No Madonna. Okay. I have that. I\'ll</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> write that down. probably, and Tom waits. I love Madonna. Tom waits.

The consensus was “yes it is,” although we’ve certainly included many WordPress-adjacent or partnered companies on our (updated) <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/acquisitions/\">Acquisitions</a> page. The <a href=\"https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx\">number-filled announcement to investors</a> and <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/619704647/files/doc_downloads/2022/DigitalOcean-Cloudways-Acquisition-Infographic.pdf\">infographic</a> from <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> make it clear they know they are buying (or rather getting deeper) into the WordPress ecosystem by acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The acquisition of Cloudways expands DigitalOcean’s serviceable market within global SMBs and increases options for <strong>digital agencies, eCommerce sites, bloggers, freelance developers and builders hosting on WordPress</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) and, according to <strong>W3Techs</strong>, it powers 43% of all websites on the internet.”</p><cite>&#8220;DigitalOcean to Acquire Cloudways&#8221; • bold text added for <strong>emphasis</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>DigitalOcean is embracing its role as a WordPress host and pivoting to define its market as, well, <em>us</em>. The bold text above highlights a large part of our membership and the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Big emphasis on SMBs.</strong> DigitalOcean sees itself expanding to gain small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in its customer demographic, and acquiring Cloudways with its WordPress and other open source eCommerce customers achieves that.</li><li><strong>Cloudways fills a big gap.</strong> There’s no easy button within DigitalOcean itself for setting up a WordPress site or anything else, but their 1-click apps are the latest progression toward something like that. It’s just not likely to appeal to most people in the low-end market <a href=\"https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_wordpress_bmm&_keyword=digitalocean%20wordpress&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eCTLbvWw706hdVQiD8CFN5sup_3G_RMowCw_QPCtG5icj3v7gGg7ORoC4ukQAvD_BwE\">in its current state</a>. DigitalOcean marketing is still locked onto startups and developers too. I imagine all this will change if Cloudways is brought in as a SMB customer-facing easy-button.</li><li><strong>New Competition.</strong> Focusing on less-technical end users and the people who build their sites will put DigitalOcean in direct competition with other WordPress-focused Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers or hosting panel middleware like <strong>ServerPilot</strong> — which only works with DigitalOcean — and <strong>SpinupWP</strong>. Even more so than Cloudways, SpinupWP is host-agnostic — any server with a public IP and (currently) <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 20.04 or 22.04 will work with SpinupWP.</li><li><strong>Will DigitalOcean drop Cloudways’ support for competitors?</strong> In addition to DigitalOcean, Cloudways can be used with <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Vultr</strong>, and <strong>Linode</strong>. Many of us wonder if that flexibility might go away now. If it does, that’s a wasted opportunity. Post Status Member <strong>Kevin Ohashi</strong> optimistically (and I hope rightly) <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C1WDQ9W05/p1661371977299379?thread_ts=1661260653.084159&cid=C1WDQ9W05\">opined nothing will be changed</a>: “If the customer isn\'t going to choose you, might as well still make money off them.”</li><li><strong>The terms “Build” and “Builder” are a large part of DigitalOcean’s messaging</strong> about the acquisition. In fact, the company’s mission is defined this way, in the context of the acquisition news release: “DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world.” This sounds a lot like WordPress’s mission updated for the era of (increasingly low/no-code) website builders (the software and the people). It’s also rather different from DigitalOcean’s main public-facing messaging which is still focused on startups and developers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Some interesting numbers from DigitalOcean:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DigitalOcean and Cloudways have been close partners since 2014.</li><li>Cloudways has approximately 50% of its customers on DigitalOcean servers.</li><li>This acquisition increases DigitalOcean’s high spend customers by 18%. They will come away from the deal with a total of 124,000+ (new plus existing) customers paying $50+ per month, which is 84% of DigitalOcean’s total revenue. ($6.2M/mo. * 12 = $74.4M/yr.)</li><li>Cloudways is projected to contribute between $13 and $15 million of revenue to DigitalOcean’s bottom line in the remaining months of FY2022 after the deal closes in September.</li><li>The acquisition of Cloudways will expand DigitalOcean’s global employee base by 30%. A good deal of those jobs are in Pakistan, and the sale represents the &#8220;Pakistan tech sector\'s largest exit to date,” according to <strong>Jawwad Farid</strong>.

I\'m also pleased I upgraded then, because after they reverted to the  original price structure I realized I\'m getting every feature of the old and new Business plan at about half the current price, although the storage is much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve dug in a little more since then, and this is clearly the best WP.com so far. Apart from some P2 demo sites, I\'ve never had much going on there. I have a second work account for &#8220;self-hosted&#8221; sites that use Jetpack, and it\'s still annoying to switch between them and manage subscriptions to comments and posts. You can only be longed into one .com identity at a time, and there\'s no way to sharing access with team members or clients except as admins of individual sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most surprising thing to see develop over the last six months or so is access to premium plugins — including Elementor and the Classic Editor, which are among the 36 &#8220;top premium plugins&#8221; listed. If you dig into the functional categories of plugins you can install, there are thousands. (I\'d love to know how these are being selected, or if all plugins in the .org repo are automatically included.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t explored how I\'d go about adding &#8220;third party code&#8221; or installing any of the 50,000+ plugins in the .org repo, but that\'s allowed on my &#8220;Pro&#8221; plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see it would be relatively easy to set up a Substack-like site at WP.com because I know the plugins you\'d need, but for the average user they\'d really have to dig into some docs and do the work of educating themselves. What\'s badly needed are something like &#8220;blueprints&#8221; for instantly installing typical configurations of plugins and themes for a common use-case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago I mapped out how I would strip down WordPress and turn it into a Substack-like membership site that used wp_mail / php_mail properly to see if I could get good deliverability with 100+ subscribers. (This is not a huge feat but a good exercise to get habituated to proper webmail/email practices that are mostly ignored, abused, or outsources as a problem for Mailgun, Mandrill, etc.) I should still do it, if I ever get the time, but it\'s cool to see a fully Open Source and better-than-Substack site becoming possible (and maybe preferable) at WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>This article was published at

Vì Node.JS cho phép lập trình bất đồng bộ nên các API của NodeJS thì <strong>non-blocking</strong>. Một NodeJS server sẽ gọi một API và sau đó nó sẽ gọi một API khác thay vì đợi kết quả của cuộc gọi lần trước.

Maps trong Go và NodeJS</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Map</strong> trong Go là <strong>hashmap</strong>, rất giống với map được sử dụng trong Python hay NodeJS. Là một cấu trúc dữ liệu, một map trong Golang là một tập hợp không có thứ tự của cặp key-value với mỗi giá trị duy nhất cho mỗi cặp. Nó khá là hữu ích cho việc lưu trữ thông tin và tìm kiếm. Cơ chế lưu trữ tương tự với NodeJS.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>12. Machine learning với Golang và NodeJS</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Với Golang, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> đáng được xem xét. Đó là một thư viện mã nguồn mở cho phép tính toán số. Tuy nhiên, API được cung cấp cho Go sẽ không cho phép các model training. Mà người dùng Go chỉ có thể sử dụng các model đã được train. Cho nên để xác định và đào tạo các model, hầu hết các dev của Go phải sử dụng Python, tải chúng lên Go sau.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Còn với NodeJS, bạn có thể tạo các model và train chúng ngay từ đầu nhưng cũng có thể sử dụng lại các model đã được train. Trong trường hợp đó, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> cũng sẽ là một sự lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Vì NodeJS cung cấp nguồn thư viện tốt hơn nên trong khía cạnh <strong>Machine learning</strong> NodeJS có lợi thế hơn Golang. Tuy vậy, cả JavaScript và Go đều không phải là lựa chọn đầu tiên với machine learning. Có rất nhiều thư viện được tạo sẵn cho Python và các ngôn ngữ khác, trong khi Go và JS yêu cầu nhiều công việc hơn.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>13. Benchmark</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Rất khó để đưa ra thời gian chính xác về việc chuyển đổi context liên quan đến các <strong>various model</strong> này.

So sánh Golang vs NodeJS</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://d50cmv7hkyx4e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19124848/cover-1024x535.jpg\" alt=\"So sánh Golang vs NodeJS\"/><figcaption>So sánh Golang với Nodejs</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"m%E1%BB%99t-s%E1%BB%91-ti%C3%AAu-ch%C3%AD-%C4%91%E1%BB%83-so-s%C3%A1nh-golang-vs-nodejs\">Một số tiêu chí để so sánh Golang vs NodeJS</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1. Việc tìm kiếm nhà phát triển</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vì NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript và nhiều nhà phát triển đã biết về nó, bạn có thể tìm nhà phát triển khá dễ dàng. Bạn sẽ cần nhiều thời gian và nỗ lực hơn để tìm các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. Learning curve</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>&nbsp;của NodeJS ít khó khăn hơn vì JavaScript đã được phổ biến rộng rãi.&nbsp;<strong>Learning curve</strong>&nbsp;của Golang thì khó khăn hơn nhiều. Trong so sánh NodeJS và Golang, NodeJS là một lựa chọn tốt hơn xét về Learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. Sự hoàn thiện</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go trải qua những phát triển và cải tiến, tuy nhiên, chúng tuân theo một mô hình có hệ thống. Mặt khác, một số API NodeJS trải qua những thay đổi thường xuyên. Điều này cho thấy sự thiếu hoàn thiện của NodeJS. Golang đã đạt được mức độ hoàn thiện hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>4. Hiệu năng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Như đã được đề cập ở trên, khi nói về hiệu năng thì phải nhắc đến Golang. Cho nên ở khía cạnh này mang lại hiệu năng cao hơn NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>5. Khả năng mở rộng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trong khi cả NodeJS và Golang đều giúp bạn tạo các ứng dụng có khả năng mở rộng, thì Golang hỗ trợ&nbsp;<strong>concurrency</strong>&nbsp;tốt hơn. Điều này làm cho nó trở thành một lựa chọn tốt hơn để viết mã các ứng dụng có thể mở rộng.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>6. Tính sẵn có của các công cụ và framework</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cộng đồng các nhà phát triển NodeJS đã tạo ra một loạt các công cụ và framework mã nguồn mở. Yếu tố này giúp người lập trình đạt năng suất cao hơn. Để so sánh, bạn sẽ tìm thấy ít công cụ và framework hơn cho Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>7. Tránh lỗi mã hóa</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go là một ngôn ngữ&nbsp;<strong>statically-typed</strong>, giúp loại bỏ phạm vi các lỗi liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>. NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript là&nbsp;<strong>dynamically-typed</strong>. Bạn có thể tìm thấy các lỗi liên quan đến&nbsp;<strong>variable types</strong>&nbsp;khó gỡ lỗi hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>8. Xử lý lỗi</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Golang yêu cầu xử lý lỗi rõ ràng. Điều này đòi hỏi một cách tiếp cận có kỷ luật và có hệ thống để mã hóa, giúp cải thiện khả năng bảo trì. Về khía cạnh này, Golang thích hơn NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>9. Triển khai</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Việc triển khai các ứng dụng được viết bằng Go dễ dàng hơn so với các ứng dụng được viết bằng NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>10. Hỗ trợ cộng đồng</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cộng đồng các nhà phát triển NodeJS rộng hơn và sôi động hơn cộng đồng các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>11. Maps trong Go và NodeJS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Map</strong>&nbsp;trong Go là&nbsp;<strong>hashmap</strong>, rất giống với map được sử dụng trong Python hay NodeJS. Là một cấu trúc dữ liệu, một map trong Golang là một tập hợp không có thứ tự của cặp key-value với mỗi giá trị duy nhất cho mỗi cặp. Nó khá là hữu ích cho việc lưu trữ thông tin và tìm kiếm. Cơ chế lưu trữ tương tự với NodeJS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>12. Machine learning với Golang và NodeJS</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Với Golang,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>&nbsp;đáng được xem xét. Đó là một thư viện mã nguồn mở cho phép tính toán số. Tuy nhiên, API được cung cấp cho Go sẽ không cho phép các model training. Mà người dùng Go chỉ có thể sử dụng các model đã được train. Cho nên để xác định và đào tạo các model, hầu hết các dev của Go phải sử dụng Python, tải chúng lên Go sau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Còn với NodeJS, bạn có thể tạo các model và train chúng ngay từ đầu nhưng cũng có thể sử dụng lại các model đã được train. Trong trường hợp đó,&nbsp;<strong>TensorFlow</strong>&nbsp;cũng sẽ là một sự lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Vì NodeJS cung cấp nguồn thư viện tốt hơn nên trong khía cạnh&nbsp;<strong>Machine learning</strong>&nbsp;NodeJS có lợi thế hơn Golang. Tuy vậy, cả JavaScript và Go đều không phải là lựa chọn đầu tiên với machine learning. Có rất nhiều thư viện được tạo sẵn cho Python và các ngôn ngữ khác, trong khi Go và JS yêu cầu nhiều công việc hơn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>13. Benchmark</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rất khó để đưa ra thời gian chính xác về việc chuyển đổi context liên quan đến các&nbsp;<strong>various model</strong>&nbsp;này. Vì vậy, thay vào đó, bài viết sẽ cung cấp cho bạn một số điểm&nbsp;<strong>benchmark</strong>&nbsp;cơ bản so sánh hiệu năng server HTTP tổng thể của các môi trường server này. Hãy nhớ rằng rất nhiều yếu tố liên quan đến hiệu năng của toàn bộ đường dẫn phản hồi HTTP end-to-end và những con số được trình bày ở đây chỉ là một số mẫu tập hợp lại để đưa ra so sánh cơ bản.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đối với mỗi môi trường, tôi đã viết mã thích hợp để đọc trong tệp 64k với các byte ngẫu nhiên, chạy hàm SHA-256 hash trên đó N số lần (N được chỉ định trong chuỗi truy vấn của URL, ví dụ: .../test.php?n=100 và in kết quả hash trong hex. Tôi chọn điều này vì đây là một cách rất đơn giản để chạy các điểm benchmark giống nhau với một số I / O nhất quán và một cách có kiểm soát để tăng mức sử dụng CPU.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đầu tiên, chúng ta hãy xem xét một số ví dụ về concurrency thấp. Chạy 2000 lần lặp với 300 yêu cầu đồng thời và chỉ một hàm hash cho mỗi yêu cầu (N = 1) cho chúng ta điều này:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thật khó để đưa ra kết luận chỉ từ một biểu đồ này, với khối lượng kết nối và tính toán này, chúng ta đang thấy nhiều việc phải làm hơn với việc thực thi chung các ngôn ngữ, nhiều hơn thế nữa để I/O. Lưu ý rằng các ngôn ngữ được coi là \"scripting languages\" (loose typing, dynamic interpretation) hoạt động chậm nhất.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nhưng điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chúng ta tăng N lên 1000, vẫn với 300 yêu cầu đồng thời - tải như nhau nhưng số lần lặp hash nhiều hơn 100 lần (tải CPU nhiều hơn đáng kể):</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Đột nhiên, hiệu suất Node giảm đáng kể, vì các hoạt động đòi hỏi nhiều CPU trong mỗi yêu cầu đang chặn lẫn nhau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bây giờ chúng ta hãy thử 5000 kết nối đồng thời (với N = 1). Thật không may, đối với hầu hết các môi trường này, tỷ lệ thất bại không phải là không đáng kể. Đối với biểu đồ này, chúng tôi sẽ xem xét tổng số yêu cầu mỗi giây. Càng cao càng tốt:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Và bức tranh trông khá khác biệt.. Rõ ràng, Go là người chiến thắng ở đây.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mặc dù có rất nhiều yếu tố liên quan đến throughput tổng thể và cũng rất khác nhau giữa các ứng dụng, nhưng bạn càng hiểu rõ về những gì đang diễn ra và những đánh đổi liên quan, bạn sẽ càng có lợi thế.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"7-golang-vs-nodejs-n%C3%AAn-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng-c%C3%A1i-n%C3%A0o\">7. Golang vs NodeJS: Nên sử dụng cái nào?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Làm cách nào để bạn quyết định có sử dụng Go vs NodeJS không? Hãy sử dụng các yếu tố sau:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Thời gian chờ đợi để tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển ứng dụng Go vs NodeJS: Nếu bạn không có nhiều thời gian để tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển, thì bạn nên chọn NodeJS. Bạn sẽ thấy việc tuyển dụng các nhà phát triển NodeJS dễ dàng hơn các nhà lập trình Golang.</li><li>Bạn chỉ muốn sử dụng một ngôn ngữ: Việc phát triển NodeJS có nghĩa là sử dụng JavaScript cho cả front-end và backend. NodeJS cung cấp đầy đủ các công cụ và framework để phát triển cả front-end và back-end. Để so sánh, Go không có thư viện GUI (giao diện người dùng) và bạn cần sử dụng thư viện của bên thứ ba. Nếu bạn muốn một bộ ngôn ngữ và framework chỉ dành cho toàn bộ quá trình phát triển ứng dụng web của mình, thì bạn nên sử dụng NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn muốn một ứng dụng có hiệu năng cao và có khả năng mở rộng: Khi bạn xem xét Golang bạn sẽ nghĩ đến khả năng mở rộng và hiệu năng của nó. Trong bài so sánh Go vs NodeJS này, Go làm tốt hơn mặt này so với NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn có các yêu cầu nghiêm ngặt về bảo mật: Go loại bỏ nhiều lỗi lập trình phổ biến, do đó, nó làm giảm các lỗ hổng bảo mật của ứng dụng. Khả năng quản lý bộ nhớ và thu gom rác mạnh mẽ của nó khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn tốt hơn NodeJS.</li><li>Bạn cần real-time data streaming: NodeJS làm tốt hơn Golang về mặt này (dễ phát triển hơn).</li><li>Bạn thích một tập hợp các quy trình phát triển, xem xét, thử nghiệm và triển khai được sắp xếp hợp lý: Bạn nên sử dụng Golang do hỗ trợ công cụ của nó để phân tích, thử nghiệm và triển khai static code. Trong so sánh Go vs NodeJS, Go đại diện cho một sự lựa chọn tốt hơn ở khía cạnh này.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tóm lại, bài viết trên đã phân tích rất kỹ các đặc điểm của cả&nbsp;<strong>NodeJS</strong>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<strong>Golang</strong>. Cả hai đều có những ưu điểm và hạn chế riêng. Bài viết cũng đã thảo luận về các trường hợp khác nhau mà bạn nên sử dụng cái này hay cái kia. Công việc tiếp theo là tùy thuộc vào bạn.

Ví dụ: Reactjs không hỗ trợ xử lý dữ liệu song song, không giống như các công cụ JS Scripting khác. Để navigate từ Div này sang Div khác trong Reactjs, trước tiên người dùng sẽ cần navigate đến parent node, sau đó đến parent node trên cùng và sau đó navigate đến phân cấp thứ hai của tree node.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"h%E1%BA%A1n-ch%E1%BA%BF-c%E1%BB%A7a-react-native\">Hạn chế của React Native</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Thiếu thư viện native</strong>: Trong trường hợp ứng dụng có nhiều chức năng, thì React Native có thể làm chậm quá trình phát triển vì lý do thiếu các thư viện native và phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào thư viện bên thứ ba.

Tuy nhiên, khi gặp những việc nhỏ, bạn nên nhân nhượng để tăng thêm lòng tin của đối phương thì bạn nên để đối phương giành phần thắng.

Tính không đồng bộ của nó loại trừ việc đợi phản hồi từ server - bạn có thể chuyển sang lệnh tiếp theo. Tuy nhiên, khái niệm về vòng lặp sự kiện mà nó sử dụng có thể trở nên khá rắc rối. Khi mọi sự kiện mới được gửi đến cuối hàng đợi, quá trình xử lý trở nên chậm hơn. Điều đó giải thích tại sao NodeJS sẽ không thực sự là ứng dụng phù hợp nhất cho các hoạt động chuyên sâu của bộ xử lý. Điều đó có thể đặt ra một thách thức đối với các nhà phát triển không quen thuộc với lập trình bất đồng bộ. Bạn cần thuê các nhà phát triển có chuyên môn phù hợp.</li>\r\n<li>NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript là <strong>dynamically typed</strong>. Nó cũng là <strong>weakly typed</strong>. Việc mắc lỗi mã hóa liên quan đến <strong>variable types</strong> là điều thường gặp khi bạn sử dụng loại ngôn ngữ này.

Do đó, các nhà phát triển nhận thấy Go rất dễ sử dụng vì ngôn ngữ này có syntax gọn gàng và rõ ràng. Điều này làm cho nó đơn giản hơn các ngôn ngữ khác.</li>\r\n<li>Vì Go đang trở nên phổ biến, nên sẽ có nhiều nhà phát triển học nó hơn. Điều này sẽ giúp việc thuê các nhà phát triển Go trở nên dễ dàng hơn trong tương lai.</li>\r\n<li>Bạn sẽ thấy dễ dàng hơn để duy trì các ứng dụng được viết bằng Go vì mã được viết bằng Go rất dễ đọc.</li>\r\n<li>Go có nhiều điểm tương đồng với C. Vì nhiều lập trình viên biết C, C # hoặc C ++, họ sẽ thấy dễ dàng học Go. Ngay cả với những người mới bắt đầu cũng không quá khó khăn để nắm bắt được ngôn ngữ này bởi vì Go rất đơn giản và trực quan.</li>\r\n<li>Go cung cấp một thư viện tiêu chuẩn tinh vi, hơn nữa, thư viện này rất dễ sử dụng. Lập trình viên không cần phải nhập các thư viện phức tạp bên ngoài hoặc phải tìm hiểu thêm các kiểu thư viện như vậy. Thư viện chuẩn Go hỗ trợ nhiều chức năng. Bạn có thể sử dụng chúng để hoàn thành nhiều nhiệm vụ và không cần phải viết những đoạn mã phức tạp.</li>\r\n<li>Go giúp các nhà phát triển viết mã không có lỗi. Vì đó là ngôn ngữ <strong>statically-typed</strong>, bạn sẽ không mắc phải những lỗi phức tạp liên quan đến <strong>variable types</strong>. Go có tính năng thu gom garbage hiệu quả và hỗ trợ quản lý bộ nhớ an toàn. Tất cả những yếu tố này làm giảm khả năng xuất hiện lỗi.</li>\r\n<li>Go giúp viết các ứng dụng an toàn và lợi thế này liên quan nhiều đến cách giúp viết mã không có lỗi. Trong thế giới ngày nay, tội phạm mạng không ngừng tìm kiếm những kẽ hở để khám phá trong các ứng dụng phần mềm. Một ngôn ngữ lập trình làm giảm khả năng xảy ra lỗi sẽ mang lại những lợi thế nhất định.</li>\r\n<li>Google tích cực hỗ trợ sự phát triển của Go và các công ty thúc đẩy nó. Gã khổng lồ công nghệ sử dụng Go rất nhiều trong các dự án của mình. Bạn có thể chắc chắn rằng Golang sẽ nhận được sự hỗ trợ phát triển mà nó cần.</li>\r\n<li>Các lập trình viên có thể tận dụng các tài liệu tuyệt vời có sẵn cho Go. Khi bạn viết một chương trình trong Go và bạn quên tạo đủ tài liệu, ngôn ngữ sẽ cảnh báo bạn.</li>\r\n<li>Go không cần <strong>interpreter</strong> vì nó là một ngôn ngữ <strong>compiled</strong>. Điều này giúp nó mang lại hiệu năng cao.</li>\r\n<li>Go hỗ trợ <strong>concurrency</strong>, giúp lập trình viên xây dựng hệ thống với mức độ xử lý song song cao.</li>\r\n<li>Go giúp các lập trình viên xây dựng các ứng dụng có khả năng mở rộng. Ngôn ngữ lập trình này giúp các nhà phát triển nhanh chóng xác định các <strong>bottleneck</strong> có thể ảnh hưởng xấu đến khả năng mở rộng của ứng dụng.

Việc tìm kiếm nhà phát triển</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Vì NodeJS dựa trên JavaScript và nhiều nhà phát triển đã biết về nó, bạn có thể tìm nhà phát triển khá dễ dàng. Bạn sẽ cần nhiều thời gian và nỗ lực hơn để tìm các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>2. Learning curve</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Learning curve</strong> của NodeJS ít khó khăn hơn vì JavaScript đã được phổ biến rộng rãi. <strong>Learning curve</strong> của Golang thì khó khăn hơn nhiều.

Sự hoàn thiện</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Go trải qua những phát triển và cải tiến, tuy nhiên, chúng tuân theo một mô hình có hệ thống. Mặt khác, một số API NodeJS trải qua những thay đổi thường xuyên. Điều này cho thấy sự thiếu hoàn thiện của NodeJS.

Hiệu năng</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Như đã được đề cập ở trên, khi nói về hiệu năng thì phải nhắc đến Golang. Cho nên ở khía cạnh này mang lại hiệu năng cao hơn NodeJS.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>5. Khả năng mở rộng</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Trong khi cả NodeJS và Golang đều giúp bạn tạo các ứng dụng có khả năng mở rộng, thì Golang hỗ trợ <strong>concurrency</strong> tốt hơn.

Xử lý lỗi</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Golang yêu cầu xử lý lỗi rõ ràng. Điều này đòi hỏi một cách tiếp cận có kỷ luật và có hệ thống để mã hóa, giúp cải thiện khả năng bảo trì. Về khía cạnh này, Golang thích hơn NodeJS.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>9.

Hỗ trợ cộng đồng</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Cộng đồng các nhà phát triển NodeJS rộng hơn và sôi động hơn cộng đồng các nhà phát triển Golang.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>11. Maps trong Go và NodeJS</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Map</strong> trong Go là <strong>hashmap</strong>, rất giống với map được sử dụng trong Python hay NodeJS. Là một cấu trúc dữ liệu, một map trong Golang là một tập hợp không có thứ tự của cặp key-value với mỗi giá trị duy nhất cho mỗi cặp. Nó khá là hữu ích cho việc lưu trữ thông tin và tìm kiếm. Cơ chế lưu trữ tương tự với NodeJS.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>12. Machine learning với Golang và NodeJS</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Với Golang, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> đáng được xem xét. Đó là một thư viện mã nguồn mở cho phép tính toán số. Tuy nhiên, API được cung cấp cho Go sẽ không cho phép các model training. Mà người dùng Go chỉ có thể sử dụng các model đã được train. Cho nên để xác định và đào tạo các model, hầu hết các dev của Go phải sử dụng Python, tải chúng lên Go sau.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Còn với NodeJS, bạn có thể tạo các model và train chúng ngay từ đầu nhưng cũng có thể sử dụng lại các model đã được train. Trong trường hợp đó, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> cũng sẽ là một sự lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Vì NodeJS cung cấp nguồn thư viện tốt hơn nên trong khía cạnh <strong>Machine learning</strong> NodeJS có lợi thế hơn Golang. Tuy vậy, cả JavaScript và Go đều không phải là lựa chọn đầu tiên với machine learning. Có rất nhiều thư viện được tạo sẵn cho Python và các ngôn ngữ khác, trong khi Go và JS yêu cầu nhiều công việc hơn.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>13.

Giúp cho công việc được hiệu quả trơn tru hơn, tránh việc khi giao tiếp không truyền đạt được hết ý của mình. Khi mọi người cùng có chung context, tất nhiên việc giao tiếp với nhau sẽ trở nên dễ dàng hơn, hiểu ý nhau hơn. Từ đó hiệu quả công việc được nâng cao hơn.
